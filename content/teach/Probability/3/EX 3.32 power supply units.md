- Scenario:
	- An electronics manufacturer claims that at most $10\%$ of power supply units need service during the warranty period.
	- Technicians purchase 20 units for accelerated testing.
	- Let $p$ represent the probability that a unit needs repair.

- Hypothesis:
	- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): $p \leq 0.10$
	- Alternative hypothesis ($H_a$): $p > 0.10$

- Decision rule:
	- Reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$ if $x \geq 5$ (where $x$ is the observed number of units needing repair).
	- Consider the claim plausible if $x \leq 4$.

- Binomial distribution:
	- The number of units needing repair follows:
    $$
    X \sim \operatorname{Bin}(20, p)
    $$

- Incorrect conclusion probability:
	- Calculate the probability of rejecting the claim when $p = 0.10$:
		- This is the probability of observing $x \geq 5$ when $p = 0.10$.
		- Use the cumulative distribution function (CDF):
    $$
    P(X \geq 5) = 1 - P(X \leq 4)
    $$

- Calculation of $P(X \leq 4)$:
	- Use the binomial probability formula:
    $$
    P(X = k) = \binom{20}{k} (0.10)^k (0.90)^{20-k}
    $$
	- Sum for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$:
    $$
    P(X \leq 4) = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \binom{20}{k} (0.10)^k (0.90)^{20-k}
    $$

- Final expression:
	- Thus, the probability of rejecting the claim incorrectly when $p = 0.10$ is:
    $$
    P(\text{Reject } H_0 \mid p = 0.10) = 1 - P(X \leq 4)
    $$

$$
\begin{align}
P(X \geq 5 \text{ when } p = 0.10) 
&= 1 - B(4; 20, 0.1) \\
&= 1 - 0.957 \\
&= 0.043
\end{align}
$$

- Incorrect conclusion analysis:
	- Consider a new scenario where $p = 0.20$.
  
- Probability that the claim is not rejected:
	- We want to find:
    $$
    P(X \leq 4 \text{ when } p = 0.20)
    $$
	- This is computed as:
    $$
    P(X \leq 4) = B(4; 20, 0.20)
    $$
	- Result:
    $$
    P(X \leq 4) = 0.630
    $$

- Interpretation of the results:
	- The first probability (rejecting the claim when $p = 0.10$) is relatively small.
	- The second probability (not rejecting the claim when $p = 0.20$) is large and deemed intolerable:
		- When the true probability of needing service is $p = 0.20$, 63% of samples will incorrectly support the manufacturer's claim.
  
- Conclusion:
	- The decision rule, as stated, may lead to significant errors in judgment, particularly when the actual proportion needing service is higher than claimed.

- Considerations for adjusting the decision rule:
	- The current cutoff value for rejecting the claim is 5.
  
	- Potential impact of changing the cutoff:
		- Replacing the cutoff of 5 with a smaller number:
    - Would likely reduce the probability of not rejecting the claim when $p = 0.20$ (making it smaller than 0.630).
    - However, this would increase the probability of rejecting the claim incorrectly when $p = 0.10$.

- Balancing error probabilities:
	- The challenge is to make both types of erroneous conclusions (Type I and Type II errors) small:
		- Type I error: Rejecting the claim when it is true.
	    - Type II error: Not rejecting the claim when it is false.

- Recommendation for reducing both error probabilities:
	- The only effective way to minimize both error probabilities is to base the decision rule on a larger sample size.
	- Increasing the sample size provides more data, which helps improve the accuracy of the decision-making process.

- Conclusion:
	- A more robust experimental design with a larger number of units will lead to better reliability in assessing the manufacturer's claim.
