The color of pea seeds is determined by a single genetic locus. 
- If the two alleles at this locus are AA or Aa (the genotype), then the pea will be yellow (the phenotype)
- if the allele is aa, the pea will be green. 

Suppose we 
- pair off 20 Aa seeds 
- cross the two seeds in each of the ten pairs to obtain ten new genotypes. 

Call each new genotype 
- a success $S$ if it is aa 
- a failure otherwise. 

Then with this identification of $S$ and $F$ , the experiment is binomial with
- $n = {10}$
- $p = P ( \text{aa genotype})$. 

If each member of the pair is equally likely to contribute a or A, then 
$$p = P\left( a\right) \cdot P\left( a\right) = \left( {.5}\right) \left( {.5}\right) = {.25}$$
