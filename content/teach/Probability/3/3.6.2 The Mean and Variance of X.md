Since $b\left( {x;n,p}\right) \rightarrow p\left( {x;\mu }\right)$ as
$n \rightarrow \infty ,p \rightarrow 0,{np} \rightarrow \mu$ , the mean
and variance of a binomial variable should approach those of a Poisson
variable. These limits are ${np} \rightarrow \mu$ and
${np}\left( {1 - p}\right) \rightarrow \mu .$

These results can also be derived directly from the definitions of mean
and variance.
