- Consider the experiment of dialing a telephone number in a certain area code using a random number dialer.
  - Define a random variable (rv) $Y$ as follows:
    - $Y = 1$ if the selected number is unlisted
    - $Y = 0$ if the selected number is listed in the directory
  - Examples:
    - If 5282966 appears in the telephone directory, then:
      - $Y(5282966) = 0$ (the number is listed).
    - If 7727350 is unlisted, then:
      - $Y(7727350) = 1$ (the number is unlisted).
  - A word description of this sort is more economical than a complete listing.
    - We will use such descriptions whenever possible.
