## BIBLIOGRAPHY
DeGroot, Morris, and Mark Schervish, Probability and Statistics (4th ed.), Addison-Wesley, Boston, MA, 2012. Includes an excellent discussion of both general properties and methods of point estimation; of particular interest are examples showing how general principles and methods can yield unsatisfactory estimators in particular situations.

Devore, Jay, and Kenneth Berk, Modern Mathematical Statistics with Applications, (2nd ed.), Springer, New York, 2012. The exposition is a bit more comprehensive and sophisticated than that of the current book.

Efron, Bradley, and Robert Tibshirani, An Introduction to the Bootstrap, Chapman and Hall, New York, 1993. The bible of the bootstrap.

Hoaglin, David, Frederick Mosteller, and John Tukey, Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis, Wiley, New York, 1983. Contains several good chapters on robust point estimation, including one on $M$ -estimation.

Rice, John, Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis (3rd ed.), Thomson-Brooks/Cole, Belmont, CA, 2007. A nice blending of statistical theory and data.
