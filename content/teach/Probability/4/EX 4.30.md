There has been recent increased use of augered cast-in-place (ACIP) and drilled displacement (DD) piles in the foundations of buildings and transportation structures. In the article "Design Methodology for Axially Loaded Auger Cast-in-Place and Drilled Displacement Piles" (J. of Geotech. Geoenviron. Engr., 2012: 1431-1441), researchers propose a design methodology to enhance the efficiency of these piles. Here are length-diameter ratio measurements based on 17 static pile load tests on

ACIP and DD piles from various construction sites. The values of $p$ for which $z$ percentiles are needed are $\left( {1 - {.5}}\right) /{17} = {.029},\left( {2 - {.5}}\right) /{17} = {.088},\ldots$ and .971 .

| \( x_{(i)} \)        | 30.86 | 37.68 | 39.04 | 42.78 | 42.89 | 42.89 | 45.05 | 47.08 | 47.08 |
|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| \( z \) percentile    | -1.89 | -1.35 | -1.05 | -0.82 | -0.63 | -0.46 | -0.30 | -0.15 |  0.00 |

| \( x_{(i)} \)        | 48.79 | 48.79 | 52.56 | 52.56 | 54.80 |       | 55.17 | 56.31 | 59.94 |
|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| \( z \) percentile    |  0.15 |  0.30 |  0.46 |  0.63 |       |  0.82|  1.05 |  1.35 |  1.89 |

Figure 4.35 shows the corresponding normal probability plot generated by the R software package. The pattern in the plot is quite straight, indicating it is plausible that the population distribution of length-diameter ratio is normal.
