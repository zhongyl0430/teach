# Introduction
The normal, gamma (including exponential), and uniform families of distributions provide a wide variety of probability models for continuous variables, but there are many practical situations in which no member of these families fits a set of observed data very well. Statisticians and other investigators have developed other families of distributions that are often appropriate in practice.
