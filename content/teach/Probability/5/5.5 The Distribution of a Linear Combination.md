## 5.5 The Distribution of a Linear Combination

The sample mean $\bar{X}$ and sample total ${T}_{o}$ are special cases of a type of random variable that arises very frequently in statistical applications.

DEFINITION

Given a collection of $n$ random variables ${X}_{1},\ldots ,{X}_{n}$ and $n$ numerical constants ${a}_{1},\ldots ,{a}_{n}$ , the rv

$$
Y = {a}_{1}{X}_{1} + \cdots + {a}_{n}{X}_{n} = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{n}{a}_{i}{X}_{i} \tag{5.7}
$$

is called a linear combination of the ${X}_{i}$ ’s.

For example, consider someone who owns 100 shares of stock A, 200 shares of stock B, and 500 shares of stock C. Denote the share prices of these three stocks at some particular time by ${X}_{1},{X}_{2}$ , and ${X}_{3}$ , respectively. Then the value of this individual’s stock holdings is the linear combination $Y = {100}{X}_{1} + {200}{X}_{2} + {500}{X}_{3}$ .

Taking ${a}_{1} = {a}_{2} = \cdots = {a}_{n} = 1$ gives $Y = {X}_{1} + \cdots + {X}_{n} = {T}_{o}$ , and ${a}_{1} =$ ${a}_{2} = \cdots = {a}_{n} = 1/n$ yields

$$
Y = \frac{1}{n}{X}_{1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}{X}_{n} = \frac{1}{n}\left( {{X}_{1} + \cdots + {X}_{n}}\right) = \frac{1}{n}{T}_{o} = \bar{X}
$$

Notice that we are not requiring the ${X}_{i}$ ’s to be independent or identically distributed. All the ${X}_{i}$ ’s could have different distributions and therefore different mean values and variances. Our first result concerns the expected value and variance of a linear combination.

PROPOSITION Let ${X}_{1},{X}_{2},\ldots ,{X}_{n}$ have mean values ${\mu }_{1},\ldots ,{\mu }_{n}$ , respectively, and variances ${\sigma }_{1}^{2},\ldots ,{\sigma }_{n}^{2}$ , respectively.

1. Whether or not the ${X}_{i}$ ’s are independent,

$$
E\left( {{a}_{1}{X}_{1} + {a}_{2}{X}_{2} + \cdots + {a}_{n}{X}_{n}}\right) = {a}_{1}E\left( {X}_{1}\right) + {a}_{2}E\left( {X}_{2}\right) + \cdots + {a}_{n}E\left( {X}_{n}\right)
$$

$$
= {a}_{1}{\mu }_{1} + \cdots + {a}_{n}{\mu }_{n} \tag{5.8}
$$

2. If ${X}_{1},\ldots ,{X}_{n}$ are independent,

$$
V\left( {{a}_{1}{X}_{1} + {a}_{2}{X}_{2} + \cdots + {a}_{n}{X}_{n}}\right) = {a}_{1}^{2}V\left( {X}_{1}\right) + {a}_{2}^{2}V\left( {X}_{2}\right) + \cdots + {a}_{n}^{2}V\left( {X}_{n}\right)
$$

$$
= {a}_{1}^{2}{\sigma }_{1}^{2} + \cdots + {a}_{n}^{2}{\sigma }_{n}^{2} \tag{5.9}
$$

and

$$
{\sigma }_{{a}_{1}{X}_{1} + \cdots + {a}_{n}{X}_{n}} = \sqrt{{a}_{1}^{2}{\sigma }_{1}^{2} + \cdots + {a}_{n}^{2}{\sigma }_{n}^{2}} \tag{5.10}
$$

3. For any ${X}_{1},\ldots ,{X}_{n}$ ,

$$
V\left( {{a}_{1}{X}_{1} + \cdots + {a}_{n}{X}_{n}}\right) = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{n}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{j = 1}}^{n}{a}_{i}{a}_{j}\operatorname{Cov}\left( {{X}_{i},{X}_{j}}\right) \tag{5.11}
$$

Proofs are sketched out at the end of the section. A paraphrase of (5.8) is that the expected value of a linear combination is the same as the linear combination of the expected values - for example, $E\left( {2{X}_{1} + 5{X}_{2}}\right) = 2{\mu }_{1} + 5{\mu }_{2}$ . The result (5.9) in Statement 2 is a special case of (5.11) in Statement 3; when the ${X}_{i}$ ’s are independent, $\operatorname{Cov}\left( {{X}_{i},{X}_{j}}\right) = 0$ for $i \neq j$ and $= V\left( {X}_{i}\right)$ for $i = j$ (this simplification actually occurs when the ${X}_{i}$ ’s are uncorrelated, a weaker condition than independence). Specializing to the case of a random sample $\left( {{X}_{i}\text{’s iid})}\right.$ with ${a}_{i} = 1/n$ for every $i$ gives $E\left( \bar{X}\right) = \mu$ and $V\left( \bar{X}\right) = {\sigma }^{2}/n$ , as discussed in Section 5.4. A similar comment applies to the rules for ${T}_{o}$ .

EXAMPLE 5.30 A gas station sells three grades of gasoline: regular, extra, and super. These are priced at $\$ {3.00},\$ {3.20}$ , and $\$ {3.40}$ per gallon, respectively. Let ${X}_{1},{X}_{2}$ , and ${X}_{3}$ denote the amounts of these grades purchased (gallons) on a particular day. Suppose the ${X}_{i}$ ’s are independent with ${\mu }_{1} = {1000},{\mu }_{2} = {500},{\mu }_{3} = {300},{\sigma }_{1} = {100},{\sigma }_{2} = {80}$ , and ${\sigma }_{3} = {50}$ . The revenue from sales is $Y = {3.0}{X}_{1} + {3.2}{X}_{2} + {3.4}{X}_{3}$ , and

$$
E\left( Y\right) = {3.0}{\mu }_{1} + {3.2}{\mu }_{2} + {3.4}{\mu }_{3} = \$ {5620}
$$

$$
V\left( Y\right) = {\left( {3.0}\right) }^{2}{\sigma }_{1}^{2} + {\left( {3.2}\right) }^{2}{\sigma }_{2}^{2} + {\left( {3.4}\right) }^{2}{\sigma }_{3}^{2} = {184},{436}
$$

$$
{\sigma }_{Y} = \sqrt{{184},{436}} = \$ {429.46}
$$

### 5.5.1 The Difference Between Two Random Variables

An important special case of a linear combination results from taking $n = 2,{a}_{1} = 1$ , and ${a}_{2} = - 1$ :

$$
Y = {a}_{1}{X}_{1} + {a}_{2}{X}_{2} = {X}_{1} - {X}_{2}
$$

We then have the following corollary to the proposition.

COROLLARY

$E\left( {{X}_{1} - {X}_{2}}\right) = E\left( {X}_{1}\right) - E\left( {X}_{2}\right)$ for any two rv’s ${X}_{1}$ and ${X}_{2}$ .

$V\left( {{X}_{1} - {X}_{2}}\right) = V\left( {X}_{1}\right) + V\left( {X}_{2}\right)$ if ${X}_{1}$ and ${X}_{2}$ are independent rv’s.

The expected value of a difference is the difference of the two expected values. However, the variance of a difference between two independent variables is the sum, not the difference, of the two variances. There is just as much variability in ${X}_{1} - {X}_{2}$ as in ${X}_{1} + {X}_{2}$ 
writing ${X}_{1} - {X}_{2} = {X}_{1} + \left( {-1}\right) {X}_{2},\left( {-1}\right) {X}_{2}$ has the same amount of variability as ${X}_{2}$ itself.

EXAMPLE 5.31 A certain automobile manufacturer equips a particular model with either a six-cylinder engine or a four-cylinder engine. Let ${X}_{1}$ and ${X}_{2}$ be fuel efficiencies for independently and randomly selected six-cylinder and four-cylinder cars, respectively. With ${\mu }_{1} = {22}$ , ${\mu }_{2} = {26},{\sigma }_{1} = {1.2}$ , and ${\sigma }_{2} = {1.5}$ ,

$$
E\left( {{X}_{1} - {X}_{2}}\right) = {\mu }_{1} - {\mu }_{2} = {22} - {26} = - 4
$$

$$
V\left( {{X}_{1} - {X}_{2}}\right) = {\sigma }_{1}^{2} + {\sigma }_{2}^{2} = {\left( {1.2}\right) }^{2} + {\left( {1.5}\right) }^{2} = {3.69}
$$

$$
{\sigma }_{{X}_{1} - {X}_{2}} = \sqrt{3.69} = {1.92}
$$

If we relabel so that ${X}_{1}$ refers to the four-cylinder car, then $E\left( {{X}_{1} - {X}_{2}}\right) = 4$ , but the variance of the difference is still 3.69.

### 5.5.2 The Case of Normal Random Variables

When the ${X}_{i}$ ’s form a random sample from a normal distribution, $\bar{X}$ and ${T}_{o}$ are both normally distributed. Here is a more general result concerning linear combinations.

---

PROPOSITION

---

If ${X}_{1},{X}_{2},\ldots ,{X}_{n}$ are independent, normally distributed rv’s (with possibly different means and/or variances), then any linear combination of the ${X}_{i}$ ’s also has a normal distribution. In particular, the difference ${X}_{1} - {X}_{2}$ between two independent, normally distributed variables is itself normally distributed.

---

EXAMPLE 5.32 (Example 5.30 continued)

---

The total revenue from the sale of the three grades of gasoline on a particular day was $Y = {3.0}{X}_{1} + {3.2}{X}_{2} + {3.4}{X}_{3}$ , and we calculated ${\mu }_{Y} = {5620}$ and (assuming independence) ${\sigma }_{Y} = {429.46}$ . If the ${X}_{i}$ ’s are normally distributed, the probability that revenue exceeds 4500 is

$$
P\left( {Y > {4500}}\right) = P\left( {Z > \frac{{4500} - {5620}}{429.46}}\right)
$$

$$
= P\left( {Z > - {2.61}}\right) = 1 - \Phi \left( {-{2.61}}\right) = {.9955}
$$

The CLT can also be generalized so it applies to certain linear combinations. Roughly speaking, if $n$ is large and no individual term is likely to contribute too much to the overall value, then $Y$ has approximately a normal distribution.

Proofs for the Case $n = 2$

For the result concerning expected values, suppose that ${X}_{1}$ and ${X}_{2}$ are continuous with joint $\operatorname{pdf}f\left( {{x}_{1},{x}_{2}}\right)$ . Then

$$
E\left( {{a}_{1}{X}_{1} + {a}_{2}{X}_{2}}\right) = {\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }{\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }\left( {{a}_{1}{x}_{1} + {a}_{2}{x}_{2}}\right) f\left( {{x}_{1},{x}_{2}}\right) d{x}_{1}d{x}_{2}
$$

$$
= {a}_{1}{\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }{\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }{x}_{1}f\left( {{x}_{1},{x}_{2}}\right) d{x}_{2}d{x}_{1}
$$

$$
+ {a}_{2}{\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }{\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }{x}_{2}f\left( {{x}_{1},{x}_{2}}\right) d{x}_{1}d{x}_{2}
$$

$$
= {a}_{1}{\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }{x}_{1}{f}_{{X}_{1}}\left( {x}_{1}\right) d{x}_{1} + {a}_{2}{\int }_{-\infty }^{\infty }{x}_{2}{f}_{{X}_{2}}\left( {x}_{2}\right) d{x}_{2}
$$

$$
= {a}_{1}E\left( {X}_{1}\right) + {a}_{2}E\left( {X}_{2}\right)
$$

Summation replaces integration in the discrete case. The argument for the variance result does not require specifying whether either variable is discrete or continuous. Recalling that $V\left( Y\right) = E\left\lbrack {\left( Y - {\mu }_{Y}\right) }^{2}\right\rbrack$ ,

$$
V\left( {{a}_{1}{X}_{1} + {a}_{2}{X}_{2}}\right) = E\left\{ {\left\lbrack {a}_{1}{X}_{1} + {a}_{2}{X}_{2} - \left( {a}_{1}{\mu }_{1} + {a}_{2}{\mu }_{2}\right) \right\rbrack }^{2}\right\}
$$

$$
= E\left\{ {{a}_{1}^{2}{\left( {X}_{1} - {\mu }_{1}\right) }^{2} + {a}_{2}^{2}{\left( {X}_{2} - {\mu }_{2}\right) }^{2} + 2{a}_{1}{a}_{2}\left( {{X}_{1} - {\mu }_{1}}\right) \left( {{X}_{2} - {\mu }_{2}}\right) }\right\}
$$

The expression inside the braces is a linear combination of the variables ${Y}_{1} =$ ${\left( {X}_{1} - {\mu }_{1}\right) }^{2},{Y}_{2} = {\left( {X}_{2} - {\mu }_{2}\right) }^{2}$ , and ${Y}_{3} = \left( {{X}_{1} - {\mu }_{1}}\right) \left( {{X}_{2} - {\mu }_{2}}\right)$ , so carrying the $E$ operation through to the three terms gives ${a}_{1}^{2}V\left( {X}_{1}\right) + {a}_{2}^{2}V\left( {X}_{2}\right) + 2{a}_{1}{a}_{2}\operatorname{Cov}\left( {{X}_{1},{X}_{2}}\right)$ as required.

### EXERCISES Section 5.5 (58-74)

58. A shipping company handles containers in three different sizes: (1) ${27}{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{3}\left( {3 \times 3 \times 3}\right)$ ,(2) ${125}{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{3}$ , and (3) ${512}{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{3}$ . Let ${X}_{i}\left( {i = 1,2,3}\right)$ denote the number of type $i$ containers shipped during a given week. With ${\mu }_{i} = E\left( {X}_{i}\right)$ and ${\sigma }_{i}^{2} = V\left( {X}_{i}\right)$ , suppose that the mean values and standard deviations are as follows:

60. Refer back to Example 5.31. Two cars with six-cylinder engines and three with four-cylinder engines are to be driven over a 300-mile course. Let ${X}_{1},\ldots {X}_{5}$ denote the resulting fuel efficiencies (mpg). Consider the linear combination

$$
Y = \left( {{X}_{1} + {X}_{2}}\right) /2 - \left( {{X}_{3} + {X}_{4} + {X}_{5}}\right) /3
$$

which is a measure of the difference between four-cylinder and six-cylinder vehicles. Compute $P\left( {0 \leq Y}\right)$ and $P\left( {Y > - 2}\right)$ . [Hint: $Y = {a}_{1}{X}_{1} + \cdots + {a}_{5}{X}_{5}$ , with $\left. {{a}_{1} = 1/2,\ldots ,{a}_{5} = - 1/3\text{.}}\right\rbrack$

61. Exercise 26 introduced random variables $X$ and $Y$ , the number of cars and buses, respectively, carried by a ferry on a single trip. The joint pmf of $X$ and $Y$ is given in the table in Exercise 7. It is readily verified that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

A large batch of the compound is subdivided and a sample given to each student in a morning lab and each student in an afternoon lab. Let $\bar{X} =$ the average $\mathrm{{pH}}$ as determined by the morning students and $\bar{Y} =$ the average $\mathrm{{pH}}$ as determined by the afternoon students.

a. If $\mathrm{{pH}}$ is a normal variable and there are 25 students in each lab, compute $P\left( {-{.1} \leq \bar{X} - \bar{Y} \leq {.1}}\right)$ .

69. Three different roads feed into a particular freeway entrance. Suppose that during a fixed time period, the number of cars coming from each road onto the freeway is a random variable, with expected value and standard deviation as given in the table.

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Road 1</th><th>Road 2</th><th>Road 3</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Expected value</td><td>800</td><td>1000</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation</td><td>16</td><td>25</td><td>18</td></tr></table>

a. What is the expected total number of cars entering the freeway at this point during the period? [Hint: Let ${X}_{i} =$ the number from road $i$ .]

b. What is the variance of the total number of entering cars? Have you made any assumptions about the relationship between the numbers of cars on the different roads?

c. With ${X}_{i}$ denoting the number of cars entering from road $i$ during the period, suppose that $\operatorname{Cov}\left( {{X}_{1},{X}_{2}}\right) = {80}$ , $\operatorname{Cov}\left( {{X}_{1},{X}_{3}}\right) = {90}$ , and $\operatorname{Cov}\left( {{X}_{2},{X}_{3}}\right) = {100}$ (so that the three streams of traffic are not independent). Compute the expected total number of entering cars and the standard deviation of the total.

70. Consider a random sample of size $n$ from a continuous distribution having median 0 so that the probability of any one observation being positive is .5 . Disregarding the signs of the observations, rank them from smallest to largest in absolute value, and let $W =$ the sum of the ranks of the observations having positive signs. For example, if the observations are $- {.3}, + {.7}, + {2.1}$ , and -2.5 , then the ranks of positive observations are 2 and 3 , so $W = 5$ . In Chapter 15, $W$ will be called Wilcoxon’s signed-rank statistic. $W$ can be represented as follows:

$$
W = 1 \cdot {Y}_{1} + 2 \cdot {Y}_{2} + 3 \cdot {Y}_{3} + \cdots + n \cdot {Y}_{n}
$$

$$
= \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{n}i \cdot {Y}_{i}
$$

where the ${Y}_{i}$ ’s are independent Bernoulli rv’s, each with $p = {.5}\left( {{Y}_{i} = 1}\right.$ corresponds to the observation with rank $i$ being positive).

a. Determine $E\left( {Y}_{i}\right)$ and then $E\left( W\right)$ using the equation for $W$ . [Hint: The first $n$ positive integers sum to $n\left( {n + 1}\right) /2$ .]

b. Determine $V\left( {Y}_{i}\right)$ and then $V\left( W\right)$ . [Hint: The sum of the squares of the first $n$ positive integers can be expressed as $n\left( {n + 1}\right) \left( {{2n} + 1}\right) /6$ .]

71. In Exercise 66, the weight of the beam itself contributes to the bending moment. Assume that the beam is of uniform thickness and density so that the resulting load is uniformly distributed on the beam. If the weight of the beam is random, the resulting load from the weight is also random; denote this load by $W$ (kip-ft).

a. If the beam is ${12}\mathrm{{ft}}$ long, $W$ has mean 1.5 and standard deviation .25 , and the fixed loads are as described in part (a) of Exercise 66, what are the expected value and variance of the bending moment? [Hint: If the load due to the beam were $w$ kip-ft, the contribution to the bending moment would be $w{\int }_{0}^{12}{xdx}$ .]

b. If all three variables $\left( {{X}_{1},{X}_{2}}\right.$ , and $\left. W\right)$ are normally distributed, what is the probability that the bending moment will be at most 200 kip-ft?

72. I have three errands to take care of in the Administration Building. Let ${X}_{i} =$ the time that it takes for the $i$ th errand $\left( {i = 1,2,3}\right)$ , and let ${X}_{4} =$ the total time in minutes that I spend walking to and from the building and between each errand. Suppose the ${X}_{i}$ ’s are independent, and normally distributed, with the following means and standard deviations: ${\mu }_{1} = {15},{\sigma }_{1} = 4,{\mu }_{2} = 5,{\sigma }_{2} = 1,{\mu }_{3} = 8$ , ${\sigma }_{3} = 2,{\mu }_{4} = {12},{\sigma }_{4} = 3$ . I plan to leave my office at precisely 10:00 A.M. and wish to post a note on my door that reads,"I will return by $t$ A.M." What time $t$ should I write down if I want the probability of my arriving after $t$ to be .01 ?

73. Suppose the expected tensile strength of type-A steel is ${105}\mathrm{{ksi}}$ and the standard deviation of tensile strength is 8 ksi. For type-B steel, suppose the expected tensile strength and standard deviation of tensile strength are ${100}\mathrm{{ksi}}$ and $6\mathrm{{ksi}}$ , respectively. Let $\bar{X} =$ the sample average tensile strength of a random sample of 40 type-A specimens, and let $\bar{Y} =$ the sample average tensile strength of a random sample of 35 type-B specimens.

a. What is the approximate distribution of $\bar{X}$ ? Of $\bar{Y}$ ?

b. What is the approximate distribution of $\bar{X} - \bar{Y}$ ? Justify your answer.

d. Calculate $P\left( {\bar{X} - \bar{Y} \geq {10}}\right)$ . If you actually observed

$\bar{X} - \bar{Y} \geq {10}$ , would you doubt that ${\mu }_{1} - {\mu }_{2} = 5$ ?

74. In an area having sandy soil, 50 small trees of a certain type were planted, and another 50 trees were planted in an area having clay soil. Let $X =$ the number of trees planted in sandy soil that survive 1 year and $Y =$ the number of trees planted in clay soil that survive 1 year. If the probability that a tree planted in sandy soil will survive 1 year is .7 and the probability of 1-year survival in clay soil is .6, compute an approximation to $P\left( {-5 \leq X - Y \leq 5}\right)$ (do not bother with the continuity correction).
