The simplest experiment to which probability applies is one with two possible outcomes.

For example
1. examining a single weld to see whether it is defective. The sample space for this experiment can be abbreviated as $\mathcal{S} = \{ N,D\}$, where
    -   $N$ represents not defective
    -   $D$ represents defective,
    -   the braces are used to enclose the elements of a set.
2. tossing a thumbtack and noting whether it landed point up or point down, with sample space $\mathcal{S} = \{ U,D\}$
3. observing the gender of the next child born at the local hospital, with $\mathcal{S} = \{ M,F\}$ .
