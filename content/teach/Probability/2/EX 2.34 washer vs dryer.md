- It is known that 
	- ${30}\%$ of a certain company's washing machines require service while under warranty, 
	- whereas only ${10}\%$ of its dryers need such service. 
- If someone purchases both a washer and a dryer made by this company, 

> [!question]
> What is the probability that *both* machines will need warranty service?

- Let 
	- $A$ denote the event that the washer needs service while under warranty, 
	- $B$ be defined analogously for the dryer. 
- Then 
	- $P\left( A\right) = {.30}$
	- $P\left( B\right) = {.10}$. 
- Assuming that the two machines will function independently of one another, 
	- the desired probability is
$$
P\left( {A \cap B}\right) = P\left( A\right) \cdot P\left( B\right) = \left( {.30}\right) \left( {.10}\right) = {.03}
$$
- It is straightforward to show that $A$ and $B$ are independent 
	- iff ${A}^{\prime }$ and $B$ are independent, 
	- iff $A$ and ${B}^{\prime }$ are independent, 
	- and iff ${A}^{\prime }$ and ${B}^{\prime }$ are independent. 
- Thus in Example 2.34, the probability that neither machine needs service is
$$
P\left( {{A}^{\prime } \cap {B}^{\prime }}\right) = P\left( {A}^{\prime }\right) \cdot P\left( {B}^{\prime }\right) = \left( {.70}\right) \left( {.90}\right) = {.63}
$$
