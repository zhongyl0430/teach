Consider an experiment that can be repeatedly performed in an identical and independent fashion, and let $A$ be an event consisting of a fixed set of outcomes of the experiment.

Simple examples of such repeatable experiments include the tack-tossing and die-tossing experiments previously discussed.

---
If the experiment is performed $n$ times, on some of the replications the event $A$ will occur (the outcome will be in the set $A$ ), and on others, $A$ will not occur.

> [!defintion]
> Let $n ( A )$ denote the number of replications on which $A$ does occur.
Then the ratio $n ( A ) /n$ is called the **relative frequency** of occurrence of the event $A$ in the sequence of $n$ replications.
