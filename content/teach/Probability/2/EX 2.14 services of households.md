In a certain residential suburb, 
- ${60}\\%$ of all households get Internet service from the local cable company, 
- ${80}\\%$ get television service from that company, 
- ${50}\\%$ get both services from that company.

If a household is randomly selected, 
- what is the probability that it gets at least one of these two services from the company 
- what is the probability that it gets exactly one of these services from the company?

---
With
-   $A$ = { gets Internet service }
-   $B$ = { gets TV service },
the given information implies that $P\left( A\right) = .6$, $P\left( B\right) = .8$, and $P\left( {A \cap B}\right) = .5$.
The foregoing proposition now yields
$$

\begin{align}
&P \left( \text{ subscribes to at least one of the two services } \right) \\
= &P \left( {A \cup B}\right) \\
= &P\left( A\right) + P\left( B\right) - P\left( {A \cap B}\right) \\
= &{.6} + {.8} - {.5} = {.9}
\end{align}

$$
---
The event that a household subscribes only to tv service can be written as ${A}' \cap B$. 
Now Figure 2.4 implies that
$$
\begin{aligned}
.9
&= P\left( A \cup B \right) = P\left( A \right) + P\left( A' \cap B \right) \\
&= .6 + P\left( A' \cap B \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
from which $P\left( A' \cap B \right) = .3$.

---
Similarly, $P\left( A \cap B' \right) = P \left( A \cup B \right) - P\left( B\right) = .1$.
This is all illustrated in Figure 2.5, from which we see that
$$

\begin{align}
P\left( \text{exactly one} \right)
&= P\left( {A \cap {B}'}\right) + P\left( {{A}' \cap B}\right) \\
&= {.1} + {.3} = {.4}
\end{align}

$$
