([[EX 2.3 pumps of gas stations]] continued)
For the experiment in which the number of pumps in use at a single six-pump gas station is observed, let
-   $A = \{ 0,1,2,3,4 \}$
-   $B = \{ 3,4,5,6 \}$
-   $C = \{ 1,3,5 \}$

Then
-   $A' = \{ 5,6\}$
-   $A \cup B = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\} = \mathcal{E}$
-   $A \cup C = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5\}$
-   $A \cap B = \{ 3,4\}$
-   $A \cap C = \{ 1,3\}$
-   $\left( A \cap C \right)' = \{ 0,2,4,5,6\}$
