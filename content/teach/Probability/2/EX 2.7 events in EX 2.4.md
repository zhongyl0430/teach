([[EX 2.4 infinitely many outputs]] continued)

The sample space for the program compilation experiment contains an
infinite number of outcomes, so there are an infinite number of simple
events.

Compound events
-   $A$ = $\{ S,{FS},{FFS}\}$ = the event that at most three programs are examined
-   $E$ = $\{ {FS},{FFFS},{FFFFS},\ldots \}$ = the event that an even number of programs are examined
