- [[EX 2.24|Example 2.24]] demonstrates that when outcomes are equally likely, 
	- computation of conditional probabilities can be based on intuition. 
- When experiments are more complicated, though, intuition may fail us, 
	- so a general definition of conditional probability is needed that will yield intuitive answers in simple problems. 
- The Venn diagram and Equation (2.2) suggest how to proceed.

> [!definition] conditional probability
> For any two events $A$ and $B$ with $P\left( B\right) > 0$ , the **conditional probability** of $A$ given that $B$ has occurred is defined by
> $$P\left( {A \mid B}\right) = \frac{P\left( {A \cap B}\right) }{P\left( B\right) } \tag{2.3}$$
