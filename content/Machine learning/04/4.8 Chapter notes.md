# 4.8 Chapter notes

The structural risk minimization (SRM) technique is due to Vapnik
\[1998\]. The original penalty term used by Vapnik \[1998\] is based on
the VC-dimension of the hypothesis set. The version of SRM with
Rademacher complexity-based penalties that we present here leads to
finer data-dependent learning guarantees. Penalties based on alternative
complexity measures can be used similarly leading to learning bounds in
terms of the corresponding complexity measure \[Bartlett et al.,
2002a\].

An alternative model selection theory of Voted Risk Minimization (VRM)
has been recently developed by Cortes, Mohri, and Syed \[2014\] and
other related publications \[Kuznetsov et al., 2014, DeSalvo et al.,
2015, Cortes et al., 2015\].

Theorem 4.7 is due to Zhang \[2003a\]. The proof given here is somewhat
different and simpler.
