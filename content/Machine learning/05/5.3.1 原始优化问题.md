### 5.3.1 原始优化问题

This leads to the following general optimization problem defining SVMs in the non-separable case where the parameter $C \geq 0$ determines the trade-off between margin-maximization (or minimization of $\parallel \mathbf{w}{\parallel }^{2}$ ) and the minimization of the slack penalty $\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{m}{\xi }_{i}^{p}$ :

$$
\mathop{\min }\limits_{{\mathbf{w}, b,\mathbf{\xi }}}\frac{1}{2}\parallel \mathbf{w}{\parallel }^{2} + C\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{m}{\xi }_{i}^{p} \tag{5.24}
$$

$$
\text{subject to}{y}_{i}\left( {\mathbf{w} \cdot {\mathbf{x}}_{i} + b}\right) \geq 1 - {\xi }_{i} \land {\xi }_{i} \geq 0, i \in \left\lbrack m\right\rbrack \text{,}
$$

where $\mathbf{\xi } = {\left( {\xi }_{1},\ldots ,{\xi }_{m}\right) }^{\top }$ . The parameter $C$ is typically determined via $n$ -fold cross-validation (see section 4.5).

As in the separable case, (5.24) is a convex optimization problem since the constraints are affine and thus convex and since the objective function is convex for any $p \geq 1$ . In particular, $\mathbf{\xi } \mapsto \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{m}{\xi }_{i}^{p} = \parallel \mathbf{\xi }{\parallel }_{p}^{p}$ is convex in view of the convexity of the norm $\parallel \cdot {\parallel }_{p}$ .

There are many possible choices for $p$ leading to more or less aggressive penaliza-tions of the slack terms (see exercise 5.1). The choices $p = 1$ and $p = 2$ lead to the most straightforward solutions and analyses. The loss functions associated with $p = 1$ and $p = 2$ are called the hinge loss and the quadratic hinge loss, respectively. Figure 5.5 shows the plots of these loss functions as well as that of the standard zero-one loss function. Both hinge losses are convex upper bounds on the zero-one loss, thus making them well suited for optimization. In what follows, the analysis is presented in the case of the hinge loss $\left( {p = 1}\right)$ , which is the most widely used loss function for SVMs.

Both the hinge loss and the quadratic hinge loss provide convex upper bounds on the binary zero-one loss.
