Even for a relatively small value of $n$ , the computation of binomial
probabilities can be tedious. Appendix Table A. 1 tabulates the cdf
$F\left( x\right) = P\left( {X \leq x}\right)$ for
$n = 5,{10},{15},{20},{25}$ in combination with selected values of $p$
corresponding to different columns of the table. Various other
probabilities can then be calculated using the proposition on cdf's from
Section 3.2. A table entry of 0 signifies only that the probability is 0
to three significant digits since all table entries are actually
positive.
