* When a student calls a university help desk for technical support
	* Two possible outcomes:
	    + Immediately speak to someone ($S$, for success)
	    + Be placed on hold ($F$, for failure)
  - Define a sample space $\mathcal{S} = \{ S,F\}$
  * Define an rv $X$ by 
$$X\left( S\right) = 1,\;X\left( F\right) = 0$$

The rv $X$ indicates whether (1) or not (0) the student can immediately speak to someone.
