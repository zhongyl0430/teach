which the individual was cited during the last 3 years. The pmf of $Y$
is

a\. Compute $E\left( Y\right)$ .

b\. Suppose an individual with $Y$ violations incurs a surcharge of
$\$ {100}{Y}^{2}$ . Calculate the expected amount of the surcharge.

31\. Refer to Exercise 12 and calculate $V\left( Y\right)$ and
${\sigma }_{Y}$ . Then determine the probability that $Y$ is within 1
standard deviation of its mean value.

32\. A certain brand of upright freezer is available in three different
rated capacities: ${16}{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{3},{18}{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{3}$ ,
and ${20}{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{3}$ . Let $X =$ the rated capacity of a
freezer of this brand sold at a certain store. Suppose that $X$ has pmf

::: center
:::

a\. Compute $E\left( X\right) ,E\left( {X}^{2}\right)$ , and
$V\left( X\right)$ .

b\. If the price of a freezer having capacity $X$ is ${70X} - {650}$ ,
what is the expected price paid by the next customer to buy a freezer?

c\. What is the variance of the price paid by the next customer?

d\. Suppose that although the rated capacity of a freezer is $X$ , the
actual capacity is $h\left( X\right) = X - {.008}{X}^{2}$ . What is the
expected actual capacity of the freezer purchased by the next customer?

33\. Let $X$ be a Bernoulli rv with pmf as in Example 3.18.

a\. Compute $E\left( {X}^{2}\right)$ .

b\. Show that $V\left( X\right) = p\left( {1 - p}\right)$ .

c\. Compute $E\left( {X}^{79}\right)$ .

34\. Suppose that the number of plants of a particular type found in a
rectangular sampling region (called a quadrat by ecologists) in a
certain geographic area is an rv $X$ with pmf

$$p\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \mathrm{c}/{x}^{3} & x = 1,2,3,\ldots \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{array}\right.$$

Is $E\left( X\right)$ finite? Justify your answer (this is another
distribution that statisticians would call heavy-tailed).

35\. A small market orders copies of a certain magazine for its magazine
rack each week. Let $X =$ demand for the magazine, with pmf

::: center
:::

Suppose the store owner actually pays $\$ {2.00}$ for each copy of the
magazine and the price to customers is $\$ {4.00}$ . If magazines left
at the end of the week have no salvage value, is it better to order
three or four copies of the magazine? \[Hint: For both three and four
copies ordered, express net revenue as a function of demand $X$ , and
then compute the expected revenue.\]

36\. Let $X$ be the damage incurred (in $\$$ ) in a certain type of
accident during a given year. Possible $X$ values are 0, ${1000},{5000}$
, and 10000, with probabilities .8,.1,.08, and .02 , respectively. A
particular company offers a \$500 deductible policy. If the company
wishes its expected profit to be $\$ {100}$ , what premium amount should
it charge?

37\. The $n$ candidates for a job have been ranked $1,2,3,\ldots ,n$ .
Let $X =$ the rank of a randomly selected candidate, so that $X$ has pmf

$$p\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1/n & x = 1,2,3,\ldots ,n \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{array}\right.$$

(this is called the discrete uniform distribution). Compute
$E\left( X\right)$ and $V\left( X\right)$ using the shortcut formula.
\[Hint: The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is
$n\left( {n + 1}\right) /2$ , whereas the sum of their squares is
$n\left( {n + 1}\right) \left( {{2n} + 1}\right) /6$ .\]

38\. Possible values of $X$ , the number of components in a system
submitted for repair that must be replaced, are 1 , 2,3, and 4 with
corresponding probabilities ${.15},{.35},{.35}$ , and .15 ,
respectively.

a\. Calculate $E\left( X\right)$ and then $E\left( {5 - X}\right)$ .

b\. Would the repair facility be better off charging a flat fee of
$\$ {75}$ or else the amount
$\$ \left\lbrack {{150}/\left( {5 - X}\right) }\right\rbrack$ ? \[Note:
It is not generally true that
$E\left( {c/Y}\right) = c/E\left( Y\right)$ .\]

39\. A chemical supply company currently has in stock
${100}\mathrm{{lb}}$ of a certain chemical, which it sells to customers
in 5-lb batches. Let $X =$ the number of batches ordered by a randomly
chosen customer, and suppose that $X$ has pmf

::: center
:::

Compute $E\left( X\right)$ and $V\left( X\right)$ . Then compute the
expected number of pounds left after the next customer's order is
shipped and the variance of the number of pounds left. \[Hint: The
number of pounds left is a linear function of $X$ .\]

40\. a. Draw a line graph of the pmf of $X$ in Exercise 35. Then
determine the pmf of $- X$ and draw its line graph. From these two
pictures, what can you say about $V\left( X\right)$ and
$V\left( {-X}\right)$ ?

b\. Use the proposition involving $V\left( {{aX} + b}\right)$ to
establish a general relationship between $V\left( X\right)$ and
$V\left( {-X}\right)$ .

41\. Use the definition in Expression (3.13) to prove that
$V\left( {{aX} + b}\right) = {a}^{2} \cdot {\sigma }_{X}^{2}$ . \[Hint:
With $h\left( X\right) = {aX} + b$ ,
$E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack = {a\mu } + b$ where
$\mu = E\left( X\right)$ .\]

42\. Suppose $E\left( X\right) = 5$ and
$E\left\lbrack {X\left( {X - 1}\right) }\right\rbrack = {27.5}$ . What
is

a\. $E\left( {X}^{2}\right)$ ? \[Hint: First verify that
$E\left\lbrack {X\left( {X - 1}\right) }\right\rbrack =$
$\left. {E\left( {X}^{2}\right) - E\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack$ ?

c\. The general relationship among the quantities $E\left( X\right)$ ,
$E\left\lbrack {X\left( {X - 1}\right) }\right\rbrack$ , and
$V\left( X\right)$ ?

43\. Write a general rule for $E\left( {X - c}\right)$ where $c$ is a
constant. What happens when $c = \mu$ , the expected value of $X$ ?

44\. A result called Chebyshev's inequality states that for any
probability distribution of an $\mathrm{{rv}}X$ and any number $k$ that
is at least
$1,P\left( {\left| {X - \mu }\right| \geq {k\sigma }}\right) \leq 1/{k}^{2}$
. In words, the probability that the value of $X$ lies at least $k$
standard deviations from its mean is at most $1/{k}^{2}$ .

a\. What is the value of the upper bound for $k = 2$ ?
$k = 3?k = 4?k = 5?k = {10}?$

b\. Compute $\mu$ and $\sigma$ for the distribution of Exercise 13. Then
evaluate $P\left( {\left| {X - \mu }\right| \geq {k\sigma }}\right)$ for
the values of $k$ given in part (a). What does this suggest about the
upper bound relative to the corresponding probability?

c\. Let $X$ have possible values $- 1,0$ , and 1, with probabilities
$\frac{1}{18},\frac{8}{9}$ , and $\frac{1}{18}$ , respectively. What is
$P\left( {\left| {X - \mu }\right| \geq {3\sigma }}\right)$ , and how
does it compare to the corresponding bound?

d\. Give a distribution for which
$P\left( {\left| {X - \mu }\right| \geq {5\sigma }}\right) = {.04}$ .

45\. If $a \leq X \leq b$ , show that $a \leq E\left( X\right) \leq b$ .
