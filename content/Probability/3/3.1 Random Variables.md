- Experimental focus
	- Many observable characteristics in experiments
	- Experimenters typically focus on specific aspects of a sample
- Examples:
    - Commuting patterns study
        - Focused characteristics:
            - Commuting distance
            - Number of people in the same vehicle
        - Ignored characteristics:
            - IQ
            - Income
            - Family size
            - Other unrelated characteristics
    - Component failure study
        - Focused characteristic:
            - Number of failures within 1000 hours
        - Ignored characteristic:
            - Individual failure times

- Random Variable
	- Definition: A rule of association that assigns a number to each outcome of an experiment
	-  Characteristics:
	    - Variable: Different numerical values are possible
	    - Random: The observed value depends on which experimental outcome occurs
	  - Examples:
	    - Number of components that fail to last 1000 hours in a sample of ten
	    - Total weight of baggage for a sample of 25 airline passengers
	  - Visual representation: Figure 3.1

> [!definition] random variable
> For a given sample space $\mathcal{S}$ of some experiment, a **random variable (rv)** is any rule that 
> - associates a number with each outcome in $\mathcal{S}$ . 
> 
> In mathematical language, a random variable is a function 
> - whose domain is the sample space 
> - whose range is the set of real numbers.

- Notation for Random Variables
  - Random Variables:
    - Denoted by uppercase letters (e.g., X, Y)
    - Usually chosen from near the end of the alphabet
  - Specific Values of Random Variables:
    - Denoted by lowercase letters
    - Contrast with previous use of lowercase letters for variables
  - Formal Notation:
    - X(ω) = x
      - X: The random variable
      - ω: A specific outcome
      - x: The value associated with outcome ω by random variable X

* Specifying an rv X
	+ In Example 3.1, $X$ was specified by:
		- Explicitly listing each element of $S$
		- The associated number
	+ However, this approach has a limitation:
		- It can be tedious if S contains more than a few outcomes
	+ Fortunately, there is an alternative:
		- Such a listing can frequently be avoided


[[EX 3.2]]

- In Examples 3.1 and 3.2, the only possible values of the random variable were 0 and 1.
	- Such a random variable arises frequently and is given a special name.
    - Named after the individual who first studied it.

> [!definition]
> Any random variable whose only possible values are 0 and 1 is called a **Bernoulli random variable**.

We will sometimes want to consider several different random variables from the same sample space.

Each of the random variables of Examples 3.1-3.3 can assume only a finite number of possible values. 
This need not be the case.
