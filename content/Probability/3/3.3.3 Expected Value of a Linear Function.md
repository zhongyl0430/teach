The $h\left( X\right)$ function of interest is quite frequently a linear function ${aX} + b$ . 
In this case, $E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack$ is easily computed from $E\left( X\right)$ without the need for additional summation.

> [!proposition]
> $$E\left( {{aX} + b}\right) = a \cdot E\left( X\right) + b$$
> Or, using alternative notation,
> $${\mu }_{{aX} + b} = a \cdot {\mu }_{X} + b$$

To paraphrase, the expected value of a linear function equals the linear function evaluated at the expected value $E\left( X\right)$ . 
Since $h\left( X\right)$ in [[EX 3.23 repurchase unsold computer]] is linear and 
$$E\left( X\right) = 2$$
$$E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack = {800}\left( 2\right) - {900} = \$ {700}$$

`\begin{proof}`
$$
\begin{align}
E(aX + b) &= \sum_{D} (ax + b) \cdot p(x) \\
&= a \sum_{D} x \cdot p(x) + b \sum_{D} p(x) \\
&= aE(X) + b
\end{align}
$$
`\end{proof}`

Two special cases of the proposition yield two important rules of expected value.
1. For any constant $a$, $$E\left( {aX}\right) = a \cdot E\left( X\right)$$ (take $b = 0$ ).
2. For any constant $b$, $$E\left( {X + b}\right) = E\left( X\right) + b$$ (take $a = 1$ ).

Effects of Constants on Expected Value:
- Multiplication by a Constant:
    - When a random variable $X$ is multiplied by a constant $a$, it changes the unit of measurement (e.g., from inches to centimeters).
    - For example, if $a = 2.54$:
      $$
      \text{New measurement} = aX
      $$
    - Rule 1: The expected value in the new units is given by:
      $$
      E[aX] = aE[X]
      $$
  
  - Addition of a Constant:
    - When a constant $b$ is added to each possible value of $X$:
      $$
      \text{New variable} = X + b
      $$
    - The expected value shifts by that same constant amount:
      $$
      E[X + b] = E[X] + b
      $$

- Implications:
	- These rules allow for straightforward adjustments of expected values when changing units or incorporating constant offsets.
	- They facilitate clearer interpretations and comparisons in various contexts, such as converting measurements or adjusting for baseline values.

- Conclusion:
	- Understanding how constants affect expected value aids in accurate calculations and meaningful interpretations in statistics and probability.
