title: 3 Discrete Random Variables and Probability Distributions
---
- Statistical analysis of experiments
    - Focus on numerical aspects of data, regardless of outcome type (qualitative or quantitative)
        - Examples:
            - Sample proportion (x/n)
            - Mean (xÌ„)
            - Standard deviation (s)
    - Use of random variables
        - Function: Convert experimental outcomes to numerical values
        - Types:
            - Discrete random variables
                - Covered in current chapter
                    - Basic properties
                    - Important examples
            - Continuous random variables
                - Covered in Chapter 4
