# Introduction
- University with 15,000 students
- Let $X$ represent the number of courses a randomly selected student is registered for
  - The pmf (probability mass function) of $X$ is provided
    - Example: $p(1) = 0.01$
      - Calculation: $(0.01) \cdot 15,000 = 150$
        - 150 students are registered for one course
    - Similarly for other $x$ values:
      - $p(x) \cdot 15,000$ gives the number of students registered for $x$ courses

- The average number of courses per student (average value of $X$) is calculated as:
	- Total number of courses taken by all students divided by the total number of students
- Example breakdown:
      - 150 students taking 1 course contribute $1(150) = 150$ courses to the total
      - 450 students taking 2 courses contribute $2(450) = 900$ courses to the total
      - And so on for other groups of students
  - The population average value of $X$ is given by:
    $$\frac{1(150) + 2(450) + 3(1950) + \cdots + 7(300)}{15,000} = 4.57 \tag{3.7}$$

- Alternative expression:
	- Since:
		- $\frac{150}{15,000} = 0.01 = p(1)$
	    - $\frac{450}{15,000} = 0.03 = p(2)$
	    - And similarly for other values
	- The population average value of $X$ can also be expressed as:
    $$1 \cdot p(1) + 2 \cdot p(2) + \cdots + 7 \cdot p(7) \tag{3.8}$$
	- This alternative expression shows that the average value of $X$ is a weighted sum of the number of courses, weighted by their probabilities.

- Expression (3.8) shows:
	- To compute the population average value of $X$, we only need:
	    - The possible values of $X$
	    - Their corresponding probabilities (proportions)
	- The population size is irrelevant as long as the pmf is given by (3.6)
- The average or mean value of $X$:
	- Is a weighted average of the possible values $1, \ldots, 7$
	- The weights are the probabilities of those values
    - For example, $p(1)$, $p(2)$, ..., $p(7)$
- This simplifies the computation since the exact number of students isn't necessary;
	- we just need the distribution of the number of courses each student takes.
