- Scenario:
	- Selecting a household in a certain region at random
	- Let \( X \) = number of individuals in the selected household
- Given probability mass function (pmf) of \( X \):
	- To be provided or determined

| x   | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   |
|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| p(x)| .140 | .175 | .220 | .260 | .155 | .025 | .015 | .005 | .004 | .001 |

Suppose this is based on 1 million households. One way to view this
situation is to think of the population as consisting of 1 million
households, each with its own $X$ value; the proportion with each $X$
value is given by $p\left( x\right)$ in the above table. An alternative
viewpoint is to forget about the households and think of the population
itself as consisting of $X$ values: ${14}\%$ of these values are
$1,{17.5}\%$ are 2, and so on. The pmf then describes the distribution
of the possible population values $1,2,\ldots ,{10}$ .
