- Scenario:
	- Selecting a household in a certain region at random
	- Let $X$ = number of individuals in the selected household
- Given probability mass function (pmf) of $X$:
	- To be provided or determined

| x   | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   |
|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| p(x)| .140 | .175 | .220 | .260 | .155 | .025 | .015 | .005 | .004 | .001 |

- Consists of 1 million households
	- Each household has its own $X$ value
    - Proportion with each $X$ value is given by $p(x)$

- Alternative Viewpoint:
	- Forget about households
	- Consider the population as consisting of $X$ values
		- $14\%$ of values are $1$
	    - $17.5\%$ are $2$
	    - And so on...

- PMF Description:
  - Describes the distribution of possible population values $1, 2, \ldots, 10$
