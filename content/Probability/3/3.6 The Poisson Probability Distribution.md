# 3.6 The Poisson Probability Distribution

The binomial, hypergeometric, and negative binomial distributions were
all derived by starting with an experiment consisting of trials or draws
and applying the laws of probability to various outcomes of the
experiment. There is no simple experiment on which the Poisson
distribution is based, though we will shortly describe how it can be
obtained by certain limiting operations.

DEFINITION A discrete random variable $X$ is said to have a Poisson
distribution with parameter $\mu \left( {\mu > 0}\right)$ if the pmf of
$X$ is

$$p\left( {x;\mu }\right) = \frac{{e}^{-\mu } \cdot {\mu }^{x}}{x!}\;x = 0,1,2,3,\ldots$$


It is no accident that we are using the symbol $\mu$
for the Poisson parameter; we shall see shortly that $\mu$ is in fact
the expected value of $X$ . The letter $e$ in the pmf represents the
base of the natural logarithm system; its numerical value is
approximately 2.71828. In contrast to the binomial and hypergeometric
distributions, the Poisson distribution spreads probability over all
non-negative integers, an infinite number of possibilities.

It is not obvious by inspection that $p\left( {x;\mu }\right)$ specifies
a legitimate pmf, let alone that this distribution is useful. First of
all, $p\left( {x;\mu }\right) > 0$ for every possible $x$ value because
of the requirement that $\mu > 0$ . The fact that
${\sum p}\left( {x;\mu }\right) = 1$ is a consequence of the Maclaurin
series expansion of ${e}^{\mu }$ (check your calculus book for this
result):

$${e}^{\mu } = 1 + \mu + \frac{{\mu }^{2}}{2!} + \frac{{\mu }^{3}}{3!} + \cdots = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{x = 0}}^{\infty }\frac{{\mu }^{x}}{x!} \tag{3.18}$$

If the two extreme terms in (3.18) are multiplied by ${e}^{-\mu }$ and
then this quantity is moved inside the summation on the far right, the
result is

$$1 = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{x = 0}}^{\infty }\frac{{e}^{-\mu } \cdot {\mu }^{x}}{x!}$$

Appendix Table A. 2 contains the Poisson cdf $F\left( {x;\mu }\right)$
for $\mu = {.1},{.2},\ldots ,1,2,\ldots ,{10}$ , 15, and 20.
Alternatively, many software packages will provide
$F\left( {x;\mu }\right)$ and $p\left( {x;\mu }\right)$ upon request.

EXAMPLE 3.38 Let $X$ denote the number of traps (defects of a certain
kind) in a particular type of metal oxide semiconductor transistor, and
suppose it has a Poisson distribution with $\mu$ $= 2$ (the Poisson
model is suggested in the article \"Analysis of Random Telegraph Noise
in 45-nm CMOS Using On-Chip Characterization System \"(IEEE Trans. on
Electron Devices, 2013: 1716-1722); we changed the value of the
parameter for computational ease).

The probability that there are exactly three traps is

$$P\left( {X = 3}\right) = p\left( {3;2}\right) = \frac{{e}^{-2}{2}^{3}}{3!} = {.180},$$

and the probability that there are at most three traps is

$$P\left( {X \leq 3}\right) = F\left( {3;2}\right) = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{x = 0}}^{3}\frac{{e}^{-2}{2}^{x}}{x!} = {.135} + {.271} + {.271} + {.180} = {.857}$$

This latter cumulative probability is found at the intersection of the
$\mu = 2$ column and the $x = 3$ row of Appendix Table A.2, whereas
$p\left( {3;2}\right) = F\left( {3;2}\right) - F\left( {2;2}\right) =$
${.857} - {.677} = {.180}$ , the difference between two consecutive
entries in the $\mu = 2$ column of the cumulative Poisson table.

## The Poisson Distribution as a Limit

The rationale for using the Poisson distribution in many situations is
provided by the following proposition.

::: mdframed
PROPOSITION
:::

Suppose that in the binomial pmf $b\left( {x;n,p}\right)$ , we let
$n \rightarrow \infty$ and $p \rightarrow 0$ in such a way that ${np}$
approaches a value $\mu > 0$ . Then
$b\left( {x;n,p}\right) \rightarrow p\left( {x;\mu }\right)$ .

According to this result, in any binomial experiment in which $n$ is
large and $p$ is small,
$b\left( {x;n,p}\right) \approx p\left( {x;\mu }\right)$ , where
$\mu = {np}$ . As a rule of thumb, this approximation can safely be
applied if $n > {50}$ and ${np} < 5$ .

EXAMPLE 3.39 If a publisher of nontechnical books takes great pains to
ensure that its books are free of typographical errors, so that the
probability of any given page containing at least one such error is .005
and errors are independent from page to page, what is the probability
that one of its 600-page novels will contain exactly one page with
errors? At most three pages with errors?

With $S$ denoting a page containing at least one error and $F$ an
error-free page, the number $X$ of pages containing at least one error
is a binomial rv with $n = {600}$ and $p = {.005}$ , so ${np} = 3$ . We
wish

$$P\left( {X = 1}\right) = b\left( {1;{600},{.005}}\right) \approx p\left( {1;3}\right) = \frac{{e}^{-3}{\left( 3\right) }^{1}}{1!} = {.14936}$$

The binomial value is $b\left( {1;{600},{.005}}\right) = {.14899}$ , so
the approximation is very good.

Similarly,

$$P\left( {X \leq 3}\right) \approx \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{x = 0}}^{3}p\left( {x;3}\right) = F\left( {3;3}\right) = {.647}$$

which to three-decimal-place accuracy is identical to
$B\left( {3;{600},{.005}}\right)$ .

Table 3.2 shows the Poisson distribution for $\mu = 3$ along with three
binomial distributions with ${np} = 3$ , and Figure 3.8 plots the
Poisson along with the first two binomial distributions. The
approximation is of limited use for $n = {30}$ , but of course the
accuracy is better for $n = {100}$ and much better for $n = {300}$ .

## The Mean and Variance of $X$

Since $b\left( {x;n,p}\right) \rightarrow p\left( {x;\mu }\right)$ as
$n \rightarrow \infty ,p \rightarrow 0,{np} \rightarrow \mu$ , the mean
and variance of a binomial variable should approach those of a Poisson
variable. These limits are ${np} \rightarrow \mu$ and
${np}\left( {1 - p}\right) \rightarrow \mu .$

::: mdframed
PROPOSITION
:::

If $X$ has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\mu$ , then
$E\left( X\right) = V\left( X\right) = \mu$ .

These results can also be derived directly from the definitions of mean
and variance.

::: mdframed
EXAMPLE 3.40

(Example 3.38 continued)
:::

Both the expected number of traps and the variance of the number of
traps equal 2, and ${\sigma }_{X} = \sqrt{\mu } = \sqrt{2} = {1.414}$ .

## The Poisson Process

A very important application of the Poisson distribution arises in
connection with the occurrence of events of some type over time. Events
of interest might be visits to a particular Web site, pulses of some
sort recorded by a counter, email messages sent to a particular address,
accidents in an industrial facility, or cosmic ray showers observed by
astronomers at a particular observatory. We make the following
assumptions about the way in which the events of interest occur:

1\. There exists a parameter $\alpha > 0$ such that for any short time
interval of length ${\Delta t}$ , the probability that exactly one event
occurs is $\alpha \cdot {\Delta t} + o\left( {\Delta t}\right)$ .\*

2\. The probability of more than one event occurring during ${\Delta t}$
is $o\left( {\Delta t}\right)$ \[which, along with Assumption 1, implies
that the probability of no events during ${\Delta t}$ is
$1 - \alpha \cdot {\Delta t} - o\left( {\Delta t}\right) \rbrack$ .

3\. The number of events occurring during the time interval ${\Delta t}$
is independent of the number that occur prior to this time interval.

Informally, Assumption 1 says that for a short interval of time, the
probability of a single event occurring is approximately proportional to
the length of the time interval, where $\alpha$ is the constant of
proportionality. Now let ${Pk}\left( t\right)$ denote the probability
that $k$ events will be observed during any particular time interval of
length $t$ .

::: mdframed
PROPOSITION
:::

${P}_{k}\left( t\right) = {e}^{-{at}} \cdot {\left( \alpha t\right) }^{k}/k!$
, so that the number of events during a time interval of length $t$ is a
Poisson rv with parameter $\mu = {\alpha t}$ . The expected number of
events during any such time interval is then ${\alpha t}$ , so the
expected number during a unit interval of time is $\alpha$ .

The occurrence of events over time as described is called a Poisson
process; the parameter $\alpha$ specifies the rate for the process.

3.41 Suppose pulses arrive at a counter at an average rate of six per
minute, so that $\alpha = 6$ . To find the probability that in a ${.5}$
-min interval at least one pulse is received, note that the number of
pulses in such an interval has a Poisson distribution with parameter

\* A quantity is $o\left( {\Delta t}\right)$ (read \"little $o$ of delta
$t$ \") if, as ${\Delta t}$ approaches 0, so does
$o\left( {\Delta t}\right) /{\Delta t}$ . That is,
$o\left( {\Delta t}\right)$ is even more negligible (approaches 0
faster) than ${\Delta t}$ itself. The quantity
${\left( \Delta t\right) }^{2}$ has this property, but
$\sin \left( {\Delta t}\right)$ does not.
${\alpha t} = 6\left( {.5}\right) = 3$ (. 5 min is used because $\alpha$
is expressed as a rate per minute). Then with $X =$ the number of pulses
received in the 30 -sec interval,

$$P\left( {1 \leq X}\right) = 1 - P\left( {X = 0}\right) = 1 - \frac{{e}^{-3}{\left( 3\right) }^{0}}{0!} = {.950}$$

Instead of observing events over time, consider observing events of some
type that occur in a two- or three-dimensional region. For example, we
might select on a map a certain region $R$ of a forest, go to that
region, and count the number of trees. Each tree would represent an
event occurring at a particular point in space. Under assumptions
similar to $1 - 3$ , it can be shown that the number of events occurring
in a region $R$ has a Poisson distribution with parameter
$\alpha \cdot a\left( R\right)$ , where $a\left( R\right)$ is the area
of $R$ . The quantity $\alpha$ is the expected number of events per unit
area or volume.
