- Distributions:
	- Binomial distribution
	- Hypergeometric distribution
	- Negative binomial distribution
	- Derived from:
		  - Experiments consisting of trials or draws
		- Application of laws of probability to various outcomes

- Poisson distribution:
	- No simple experiment as a basis
	- Obtained through:
		- Certain limiting operations (to be described shortly)

> [!definition] Poisson distribution
> A discrete random variable $X$ is said to have a Poisson distribution with parameter $\mu \left( {\mu > 0}\right)$ if the pmf of $X$ is
> $$p\left( {x;\mu }\right) = \frac{{e}^{-\mu } \cdot {\mu }^{x}}{x!}\;x = 0,1,2,3,\ldots$$

Poisson distribution:
- Symbol $\mu$:
	- Represents the Poisson parameter
	- In fact, the expected value of $X$
- Letter $e$ in the pmf:
    - Represents the base of the natural logarithm
    - Numerical value: approximately 2.71828
  - Comparison with other distributions:
	- Unlike binomial and hypergeometric distributions:
	- Spreads probability over all non-negative integers
	- Infinite number of possibilities
- Legitimacy of the Poisson pmf $p(x; \mu)$:
	- Not immediately obvious that it specifies a legitimate pmf
- Conditions:
    - $p(x; \mu) > 0$ for every possible $x$ value
	- Requires $\mu > 0$
- Normalization:
	- $\sum p(x; \mu) = 1$
	- Consequence of the Maclaurin series expansion of $e^{\mu}$:
	- $$
      e^{\mu} = 1 + \mu + \frac{\mu^{2}}{2!} + \frac{\mu^{3}}{3!} + \cdots = \sum_{x = 0}^{\infty} \frac{\mu^{x}}{x!} \tag{3.18}
      $$
- Manipulation of (3.18):
    - Multiply both extreme terms by $e^{-\mu}$
    - Move quantity inside summation:
	- Result:
		- $$
      1 = \sum_{x = 0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-\mu} \cdot \mu^{x}}{x!}
      $$
- Additional resources:
	- Appendix Table A.2 contains Poisson cdf $F(x; \mu)$ for:
    - $\mu = 0.1, 0.2, \ldots, 1, 2, \ldots, 10, 15, 20$
	- Many software packages provide:
	    - $F(x; \mu)$ and $p(x; \mu)$ upon request
