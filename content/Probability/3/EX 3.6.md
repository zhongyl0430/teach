- All random variables in Examples 3.1-3.4 are:
	- Discrete
- Additional example:
	- Scenario:
		- Selecting married couples at random
		- Performing blood tests on each person
		- Goal: Find a husband and wife with the same Rh factor
- Definition:
	- Let \( X \) = number of blood tests performed
- Possible values of \( X \):
    - \( D = \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \} \)
- Conclusion:
    - Since possible values are listed in sequence, \( X \) is:
	- A discrete random variable (rv)
