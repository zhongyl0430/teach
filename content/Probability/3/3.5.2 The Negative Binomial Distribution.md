**Conditions for Negative Binomial Random Variable and Distribution:**
1. **Independent Trials:**
	- The experiment consists of a sequence of independent trials.
1. **Binary Outcomes:**
	- Each trial can result in either a success (S) or a failure (F).
1. **Constant Probability:**
	- The probability of success is constant across trials, denoted as $P(S \text{ on trial } i) = p$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
1. **Fixed Number of Successes:**
	- The experiment continues until a total of $r$ successes have been observed, where $r$ is a specified positive integer.
- Random variable of interest: 
	- $X$ = number of failures that precede the $r$th success
	- Called a **negative binomial random variable**
	- Contrast with binomial random variable:
		- Number of successes is fixed
		- Number of trials is random
- Possible values of $X$: 
	- $0, 1, 2, \ldots$
- Notation:
	- ${nb}(x; r; p)$: pmf of $X$

- Example:
	- ${nb}(7; 3; p)$ = $P(X = 7)$
		- Probability that exactly 7 failures occur before the 3rd success
    - Conditions:
		- 10th trial must be a success
		- Exactly 2 successes among the first 9 trials
	- Calculation:
$$
	\begin{align}
      {nb}(7; 3; p) 
      &= \left\{ \left( \begin{array}{l} 9 \\ 2 \end{array}\right) \cdot p^{2} (1 - p)^{7} \right\} \cdot p \\
      &= \left( \begin{array}{l} 9 \\ 2 \end{array}\right) \cdot p^{3} (1 - p)^{7}
    \end{align}
$$
- Generalization:
	- Formula for the negative binomial pmf


> [!proposition]
The pmf of the negative binomial rv $X$ with parameters $r =$ number of
$S$ 's and $p = P\left( S\right)$ is, for all $x = 0,1,2,\ldots$,
$${nb}\left( {x;r,p}\right) = \left( \begin{matrix} x + r - 1 \\ r - 1 \end{matrix}\right) {p}^{r}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{x}$$

[[EX 3.37]] 

- Alternative definition:
	- Negative binomial random variable may be defined as:
    - Number of trials $X + r$ rather than number of failures $X$
- Special case: $r = 1$
	- pmf:
    - $$
    {nb}(x; 1, p) = (1 - p)^{x} p, \quad x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \tag{3.17}
    $$

- Relation to previous [[EX 3.12 gender of newborn child]]:
    - Derived pmf for number of trials to obtain the first success
	- Similar to Expression (3.17)
	- Both:
	    - $X$ = number of failures
	    - $Y$ = number of trials $(= 1 + X)$
	    - Referred to as geometric random variables
	- pmf in Expression (3.17):
	    - Called the **geometric distribution**

- Expected values:
	- Expected number of trials until the first success:
	    - Shown in Example 3.19 to be $1/p$
	- Expected number of failures until the first success:
	    - $\frac{1}{p} - 1 = \frac{1 - p}{p}$
	- Intuitive expectation:
	    - $r \cdot \frac{1 - p}{p}$ failures before the $r$th success
	    - This is $E(X)$
- Variance:
	- Simple formula for $V(X)$

> [!proposition]
> If $X$ is a negative binomial rv with
$\operatorname{pmf}{nb}\left( {x;r,p}\right)$ , then
> - $$E\left( X\right) = \frac{r\left( {1 - p}\right) }{p}$$
> - $$V\left( X\right) = \frac{r\left( {1 - p}\right) }{{p}^{2}}$$

Finally, by expanding the binomial coefficient in front of ${p}^{r}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{x}$ and doing some cancellation, it can be seen that ${nb}\left( {x;r;p}\right)$ is well defined even when $r$ is not an integer. 

This *generalized negative binomial distribution* has been found to fit observed data quite well in a wide variety of applications.
