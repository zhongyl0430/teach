The number of arithmetic operations necessary to compute ${\sigma }^{2}$
can be reduced by using an alternative formula.

PROPOSITION

$$V\left( X\right) = {\sigma }^{2} = \left\lbrack {\mathop{\sum }\limits_{D}{x}^{2} \cdot p\left( x\right) }\right\rbrack - {\mu }^{2} = E\left( {X}^{2}\right) - {\left\lbrack E\left( X\right) \right\rbrack }^{2}$$

In using this formula, $E\left( {X}^{2}\right)$ is computed first
without any subtraction; then $E\left( X\right)$ is computed, squared,
and subtracted (once) from $E\left( {X}^{2}\right)$ .

EXAMPLE 3.25

(Example 3.24 continued)
:::

The pmf of the number $X$ of DVDs checked out was given as
$p\left( 1\right) = {.30},p\left( 2\right) = {.25}$ ,
$p\left( 3\right) = {.15},p\left( 4\right) = {.05},p\left( 5\right) = {.10}$
, and $p\left( 6\right) = {.15}$ , from which $\mu = {2.85}$ and

$$E\left( {X}^{2}\right) = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{x = 1}}^{6}{x}^{2} \cdot p\left( x\right) = \left( {1}^{2}\right) \left( {.30}\right) + \left( {2}^{2}\right) \left( {.25}\right) + \cdots + \left( {6}^{2}\right) \left( {.15}\right) = {11.35}$$

Thus ${\sigma }^{2} = {11.35} - {\left( {2.85}\right) }^{2} = {3.2275}$
as obtained previously from the definition.

Proof of the Shortcut Formula Expand ${\left( x - \mu \right) }^{2}$ in
the definition of ${\sigma }^{2}$ to obtain
${x}^{2} - {2\mu x} + {\mu }^{2}$ , and then carry $\sum$ through to
each of the three terms:

$${\sigma }^{2} = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{D}{x}^{2} \cdot p\left( x\right) - {2\mu } \cdot \mathop{\sum }\limits_{D}x \cdot p\left( x\right) + {\mu }^{2}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{D}p\left( x\right)$$

$$= E\left( {X}^{2}\right) - {2\mu } \cdot \mu + {\mu }^{2} = E\left( {X}^{2}\right) - {\mu }^{2}$$
