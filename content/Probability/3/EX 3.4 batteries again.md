- Consider an experiment in which 9-volt batteries are tested until one with an acceptable voltage ($S$) is obtained.
- The sample space is $\mathcal{S} = \{ S, FS, FFS, \ldots \}$.
- Define a random variable (rv) $X$ as follows:
	- $X =$ the number of batteries tested before the experiment terminates.
- Observed values of $X$ based on outcomes:
    - $X(S) = 1$
    - $X(FS) = 2$
    - $X(FFS) = 3$
    - ...
    - $X(FFFFFFS) = 7$
- Any positive integer is a possible value of $X$.
    - Therefore, the set of possible values is infinite.
