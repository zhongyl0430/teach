11\. Let $X$ be the number of students who show up for a professor's
office hour on a particular day. Suppose that the pmf of $X$ is
$p\left( 0\right) = {.20},p\left( 1\right) = {.25},p\left( 2\right) = {.30},p\left( 3\right) =$
${.15}$ , and $p\left( 4\right) = {.10}$ .

a\. Draw the corresponding probability histogram.

b\. What is the probability that at least two students show up? More
than two students show up?

c\. What is the probability that between one and three students,
inclusive, show up?

d\. What is the probability that the professor shows up?

12\. Airlines sometimes overbook flights. Suppose that for a plane with
50 seats, 55 passengers have tickets. Define the random variable $Y$ as
the number of ticketed passengers who actually show up for the flight.
The probability mass function of $Y$ appears in the accompanying table.

a\. What is the probability that the flight will accommodate all
ticketed passengers who show up?

b\. What is the probability that not all ticketed passengers who show up
can be accommodated?

c\. If you are the first person on the standby list (which means you
will be the first one to get on the plane if there are any seats
available after all ticketed passengers have been accommodated), what is
the probability that you will be able to take the flight? What is this
probability if you are the third person on the standby list?

13\. A mail-order computer business has six telephone lines. Let $X$
denote the number of lines in use at a specified time. Suppose the pmf

a\. {at most three lines are in use }

b\. {fewer than three lines are in use }

c\. {at least three lines are in use }

d\. {between two and five lines, inclusive, are in use }

14\. A contractor is required by a county planning department to submit
one, two, three, four, or five forms (depending on the nature of the
project) in applying for a building permit. Let $Y =$ the number of
forms required of the next applicant. The probability that $y$ forms are
required is known to be proportional to $y$ -that is,
$p\left( y\right) = {ky}$ for $y = 1,\ldots ,5$ .

a\. What is the value of $k$ ? \[Hint:
${\sum }_{y = 1}^{5}p\left( y\right) = 1$ \]

are required?

d\. Could $p\left( y\right) = {y}^{2}/{50}$ for $y = 1,\ldots ,5$ be the
pmf of $Y$ ?

15\. Many manufacturers have quality control programs that include
inspection of incoming materials for defects. Suppose a computer
manufacturer receives circuit boards in batches of five. Two boards are
selected from each batch for inspection. We can represent possible
outcomes of the selection process by pairs. For example, the pair
$\left( {1,2}\right)$ represents the selection of boards 1 and 2 for
inspection.

a\. List the ten different possible outcomes.

b\. Suppose that boards 1 and 2 are the only defective boards in a
batch. Two boards are to be chosen at random. Define $X$ to be the
number of defective boards observed among those inspected. Find the
probability distribution of $X$ .

c\. Let $F\left( x\right)$ denote the cdf of $X$ . First determine
$F\left( 0\right) =$ $P\left( {X \leq 0}\right) ,F\left( 1\right)$ , and
$F\left( 2\right)$ ; then obtain $F\left( x\right)$ for all other $x$ .

16\. Some parts of California are particularly earthquake-prone. Suppose
that in one metropolitan area, ${25}\%$ of all homeowners are insured
against earthquake damage. Four homeowners are to be selected at random;
let $X$ denote the number among the four who have earthquake insurance.

a\. Find the probability distribution of $X$ . \[Hint: Let $S$ denote a
homeowner who has insurance and $F$ one who does not. Then one possible
outcome is SFSS, with probability
$\left( {.25}\right) \left( {.75}\right) \left( {.25}\right) \left( {.25}\right)$
and associated $X$ value 3. There are 15 other outcomes.\]

b\. Draw the corresponding probability histogram.

c\. What is the most likely value for $X$ ?

d\. What is the probability that at least two of the four selected have
earthquake insurance?

17\. A new battery's voltage may be acceptable $\left( A\right)$ or
unacceptable $\left( U\right)$ . A certain flashlight requires two
batteries, so batteries will be independently selected and tested until
two acceptable ones have been found. Suppose that ${90}\%$ of all
batteries have acceptable voltages. Let $Y$ denote the number of
batteries that must be tested.

a\. What is $p\left( 2\right)$ , that is, $P\left( {Y = 2}\right)$ ?

b\. What is $p\left( 3\right)$ ? \[Hint: There are two different
outcomes that result in $Y = 3$ .\]

c\. To have $Y = 5$ , what must be true of the fifth battery selected?
List the four outcomes for which $Y = 5$ and then determine
$p\left( 5\right)$ .

d\. Use the pattern in your answers for parts (a)-(c) to obtain a
general formula for $p\left( y\right)$ .

18\. Two fair six-sided dice are tossed independently. Let $M =$ the
maximum of the two tosses (so $M\left( {1,5}\right) = 5$ ,
$M\left( {3,3}\right) = 3$ , etc.).

a\. What is the pmf of $M$ ? \[Hint: First determine $p\left( 1\right)$
, then $p\left( 2\right)$ , and so on.\]

b\. Determine the cdf of $M$ and graph it.

19\. A library subscribes to two different weekly news magazines, each
of which is supposed to arrive in Wednesday's mail. In actuality, each
one may arrive on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. Suppose the
two arrive independently of one another, and for each one
$P\left( \text{Wed.}\right) = {.3}$ ,
$P\left( \text{Thurs.}\right) = {.4},\;P\left( \text{Fri.}\right) = {.2}$
, and $\;P\left( \text{Sat.}\right) = {.1}$ . Let $Y =$ the number of
days beyond Wednesday that it takes for both magazines to arrive (so
possible $Y$ values are 0,1, 2, or 3). Compute the pmf of $Y$ . \[Hint:
There are 16 possible outcomes;
$Y\left( {W,W}\right) = 0,Y\left( {F,{Th}}\right) = 2$ , and so on.\]

20\. Three couples and two single individuals have been invited to an
investment seminar and have agreed to attend. Suppose the probability
that any particular couple or individual arrives late is .4 (a couple
will travel together in the same vehicle, so either both people will be
on time or else both will arrive late). Assume that different couples
and individuals are on time or late independently of one another. Let
$X =$ the number of people who arrive late for the seminar.

a\. Determine the probability mass function of $X$ . \[Hint: label the
three couples $\# 1,\# 2$ , and $\# 3$ and the two individuals #4 and
#5.\]

b\. Obtain the cumulative distribution function of $X$ , and use it to
calculate $P\left( {2 \leq X \leq 6}\right)$ .

21\. Suppose that you read through this year's issues of the New York
Times and record each number that appears in a news article-the income
of a CEO, the number of cases of wine produced by a winery, the total
charitable contribution of a politician during the previous tax year,
the age of a celebrity, and so on. Now focus on the leading digit of
each number, which could be $1,2,\ldots ,8$ , or 9 . Your first thought
might be that the leading digit $X$ of a randomly selected number would
be equally likely to be one of the nine possibilities (a discrete
uniform distribution). However, much empirical evidence as well as some
theoretical arguments suggest an alternative probability distribution
called Benford's law:

$$p\left( x\right) = P\left( {1\text{ st digit is }x}\right) = {\log }_{10}\left( \frac{x + 1}{x}\right) \;x = 1,2,\ldots ,9$$

a\. Without computing individual probabilities from this formula, show
that it specifies a legitimate pmf.

b\. Now compute the individual probabilities and compare to the
corresponding discrete uniform distribution.

c\. Obtain the cdf of $X$ .

d\. Using the cdf, what is the probability that the leading digit is at
most 3 ? At least 5 ?

\[Note: Benford's law is the basis for some auditing procedures used to
detect fraud in financial reporting-for example, by the Internal Revenue
Service.\]

22\. Refer to Exercise 13, and calculate and graph the cdf
$F\left( x\right)$ . Then use it to calculate the probabilities of the
events given in parts (a)-(d) of that problem.

23\. A branch of a certain bank in New York City has six ATMs. Let $X$
represent the number of machines in use at a particular time of day. The
cdf of $X$ is as follows:

$$F\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0 & x < 0 \\ {.06} & 0 \leq x < 1 \\ {.19} & 1 \leq x < 2 \\ {.39} & 2 \leq x < 3 \\ {.67} & 3 \leq x < 4 \\ {.92} & 4 \leq x < 5 \\ {.97} & 5 \leq x < 6 \\ 1 & 6 \leq x \end{array}\right.$$

Calculate the following probabilities directly from the cdf:

a\. $p\left( 2\right)$ , that is, $P\left( {X = 2}\right)$ b.
$P\left( {X > 3}\right)$

c\. $P\left( {2 \leq X \leq 5}\right)$ d. $P\left( {2 < X < 5}\right)$

24\. An insurance company offers its policyholders a number of different
premium payment options. For a randomly selected policyholder, let $X =$
the number of months between successive payments. The cdf of $X$ is as
follows:

$$F\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0 & x < 1 \\ {.30} & 1 \leq x < 3 \\ {.40} & 3 \leq x < 4 \\ {.45} & 4 \leq x < 6 \\ {.60} & 6 \leq x < {12} \\ 1 & {12} \leq x \end{array}\right.$$

a\. What is the pmf of $X$ ?

b\. Using just the cdf, compute $P\left( {3 \leq X \leq 6}\right)$ and
$P\left( {4 \leq X}\right)$ .

25\. In Example 3.12, let $Y =$ the number of girls born before the
experiment terminates. With $p = P\left( B\right)$ and
$1 - p = P\left( G\right)$ , what is the pmf of $Y$ ? \[Hint: First list
the possible values of $Y$ , starting with the smallest, and proceed
until you see a general formula.\]

26\. Alvie Singer lives at 0 in the accompanying diagram and has four
friends who live at $A,B,C$ , and $D$ . One day Alvie decides to go
visiting, so he tosses a fair coin twice to decide which of the four to
visit. Once at a friend's house, he will either return home or else
proceed to one of the two adjacent houses (such as $0,A$ , or $C$ when
at $B$ ), with each of the three possibilities having probability

$1/3$ . In this way, Alvie continues to visit friends until he returns
home.

27\. After all students have left the classroom, a statistics professor
notices that four copies of the text were left under desks. At the
beginning of the next lecture, the professor distributes the four books
in a completely random fashion to each of the four students
$\left( {1,2,3\text{,and 4}}\right)$ who claim to have left books. One
possible outcome is that 1 receives 2's book, 2 receives 4's book, 3
receives his or her own book, and 4 receives 1's book. This outcome can
be abbreviated as $\left( {2,4,3,1}\right)$ .

a\. List the other 23 possible outcomes.

b\. Let $X$ denote the number of students who receive their own book.
Determine the pmf of $X$ .

28\. Show that the cdf $F\left( x\right)$ is a nondecreasing function;
that is, ${x}_{1} < {x}_{2}$ implies that
$F\left( {x}_{1}\right) \leq F\left( {x}_{2}\right)$ . Under what
condition will $F\left( {x}_{1}\right) = F\left( {x}_{2}\right)$ ?
