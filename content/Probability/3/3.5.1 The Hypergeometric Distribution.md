Assumptions for the Hypergeometric Distribution:
1. **Finite Population:**
	- The population or set to be sampled consists of $N$ individuals, objects, or elements.
2. **Characterizaion of Individuals:**
	- Each individual can be classified as a success $(S)$ or a failure $(F)$.
	- There are $M$ successes in the population.
1. **Sampling Without Replacement:**
	- A sample of $n$ individuals is selected without replacement.
	- Each subset of size $n$ is equally likely to be chosen.
- Random Variable of Interest:
	- $X$: the number of successes $S$ in the sample.
	- Probability distribution of $X$:
	    - Depends on parameters $n$, $M$, and $N$.
		- Expressed as $P(X = x) = h(x; n, M, N)$.

Possible Values of $X$:
1. **Upper Limit of $X$:**
	- If $n \leq M$: 
		- The largest possible $X$ value is $n$.
	- If $M < n$: 
		- The largest possible $X$ value is $M$.
1. **Lower Limit of $X$:**
	- If $N - M \geq n$: 
		- The smallest possible $X$ value is 0 (all sampled may be failures).
	- If $N - M < n$: 
		- The smallest possible $X$ value is $n - (N - M)$.
1. **Restrictions on $X$:**
	- The values of $X$ must satisfy:
       $$
       \max(0, n - (N - M)) \leq x \leq \min(n, M)
       $$

Probability Mass Function (pmf):
- An argument similar to previous examples leads to the derivation of the pmf of $X$.

In [[EX 3.34 printer problem]], $n = 5$, $M = {12}$ , and $N = {20}$, so $h\left( {x;5,{12},{20}}\right)$ for $x = 0,1,2$ , 3, 4, 5 can be obtained by substituting these numbers into Equation (3.15).

> [!remark]
> Various statistical software packages will easily generate hypergeometric probabilities (tabulation is cumbersome because of the three parameters).

As in the binomial case, there are simple expressions for $E\left( X\right)$ and $V\left( X\right)$ for hypergeometric rv's.

> [!proposition]
The mean and variance of the hypergeometric rv $X$ having pmf $h\left( {x;n,M,N}\right)$ are
> $$
> \begin{align}
> E\left( X\right) 
> &= n \cdot \frac{M}{N}\;V\left( X\right) \\
> &= \left( \frac{N - n}{N - 1}\right) \cdot n \cdot \frac{M}{N} \cdot \left( {1 - \frac{M}{N}}\right)
> \end{align}
> $$

- The ratio $M/N$ is the proportion of $S$ 's in the population. 
- Replacing $M/N$ by $p$ in $E\left( X\right)$ and $V\left( X\right)$ gives
	- $$E\left( X\right) = {np}$$
	- $$V\left( X\right) = \left( \frac{N - n}{N - 1}\right) \cdot {np}\left( {1 - p}\right) \tag{3.16}$$

**Comparison of Binomial and Hypergeometric Random Variables:**
  1. **Means:**
     - The means of both the binomial and hypergeometric rv's are equal:
       $$
       E[X]_{\text{binomial}} = E[X]_{\text{hypergeometric}}
       $$
  2. **Variances:**
     - The variances differ by a finite population correction factor:
       $$
       V[X]_{\text{hypergeometric}} = V[X]_{\text{binomial}} \cdot \frac{N - n}{N - 1}
       $$
     - This factor is less than 1, indicating that the hypergeometric variable has smaller variance than the binomial variable.
  3. **Finite Population Correction Factor:**
     - Can also be expressed as:
       $$
       \frac{1 - n/N}{1 - 1/N}
       $$
     - Approximately equal to 1 when $n$ is small relative to $N$.

**Rule for Approximating Hypergeometric by Binomial Distribution:**
  1. **General Guideline:**
     - If sampling is without replacement and the ratio $n/N$ is at most 0.05, the binomial distribution can be used to approximate probabilities related to the number of successes $S$ in the sample.
  2. **More Precise Statement:**
     - As both the population size $N$ and the number of successes $M$ increase, with the ratio $M/N$ approaching a probability $p$:
       $$
       h(x; n, M, N) \approx b(x; n, p)
       $$
     - This approximation holds when $n/N$ is small and $p$ is not too close to 0 or 1.
  3. **Rationale:**
     - The rationale for this approximation is that under these conditions, the hypergeometric distribution behaves similarly to the binomial distribution.
