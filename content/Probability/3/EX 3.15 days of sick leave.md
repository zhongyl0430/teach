Let $X =$ the number of days of sick leave taken by a randomly selected employee of a large company during a particular year.
If the maximum number of allowable sick days per year is 14, possible values of $X$ are $0,1,\ldots ,{14}$ . 
With
- $F\left( 0\right) = {.58}$
- $F\left( 1\right) = {.72}$
- $F\left( 2\right) = {.76}$
- $F\left( 3\right) = {.81}$
- $F\left( 4\right) = {.88}$
- $F\left( 5\right) = {.94}$ ,
We have
$$
\begin{align}
P(2 \leq X \leq 5) &= P(X = 2, 3, 4 \text{, or } 5) \\
                   &= F(5) - F(1) \\
                   &= 0.22
\end{align}
$$
and
$$P\left( {X = 3}\right) = F\left( 3\right) - F\left( 2\right) = {.05}$$
