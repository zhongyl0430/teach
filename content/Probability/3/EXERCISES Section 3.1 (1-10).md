A concrete beam may fail either by shear $\left( S\right)$ or flexure $\left( F\right)$ . Suppose that three failed beams are randomly selected and the type of failure is determined for each one. Let $X  =$ the number of beams among the three selected that failed by shear. List each outcome in the sample space along with the associated value of $X$. 

# 2
Give three examples of Bernoulli rv's (other than those in the text).

# 3
Using the experiment in Example 3.3, define two more random variables and list the possible values of each.

# 4
Let $X =$ the number of nonzero digits in a randomly selected 4-digit PIN that has no restriction on the digits.

What are the possible values of $X$ ? Give three possible outcomes and their associated $X$ values.

# 5
If the sample space $\mathcal{S}$ is an infinite set, does this necessarily imply that any rv $X$ defined from $\mathcal{S}$ will have an infinite set of possible values? If yes, say why. If no, give an example.

# 6
Starting at a fixed time, each car entering an intersection is observed to see whether it turns left $\left( L\right)$ , right $\left( R\right)$ , or goes straight ahead $\left( A\right)$ . The experiment terminates as soon as a car is observed to turn left. Let $X =$ the number of cars observed. What are possible $X$ values? List five outcomes and their associated $X$ values.

# 7 
For each random variable defined here, describe the set of possible values for the variable, and state whether the variable is discrete.

a\. $X =$ the number of unbroken eggs in a randomly chosen standard egg carton

b\. $Y =$ the number of students on a class list for a particular course who are absent on the first day of classes

c\. $U =$ the number of times a duffer has to swing at a golf ball before hitting it

d\. $X =$ the length of a randomly selected rattlesnake

e\. $Z =$ the sales tax percentage for a randomly selected amazon.com purchase

f\. $Y =$ the $\mathrm{{pH}}$ of a randomly chosen soil sample

g\. $X =$ the tension (psi) at which a randomly selected tennis racket has been strung

h\. $X =$ the total number of times three tennis players must spin their rackets to obtain something other than ${UUU}$ or ${DDD}$ (to determine which two play next)

# 8
Each time a component is tested, the trial is a success $\left( S\right)$ or failure $\left( F\right)$ . Suppose the component is tested repeatedly until a success occurs on three consecutive trials.
Let $Y$ denote the number of trials necessary to achieve this. List all outcomes corresponding to the five smallest possible values of $Y$ , and state which $Y$ value is associated with each one.

An individual named Claudius is located at the point 0 in the accompanying diagram.

![image](images/019165cb-e657-75f5-b964-f15ddb80567f_5_649683.jpg)

Using an appropriate randomization device (such as a tetrahedral die, one having four sides), Claudius first moves to one of the four locations ${B}_{1},{B}_{2},{B}_{3},{B}_{4}$ . Once at one of these locations, another randomization device is used to decide whether Claudius next returns to 0 or next visits one of the other two adjacent points. This process then continues; after each move, another move to one of the (new) adjacent points is determined by tossing an appropriate die or coin.

a\. Let $X =$ the number of moves that Claudius makes before first returning to 0 . What are possible values of $X$? Is $X$ discrete or continuous?

b\. If moves are allowed also along the diagonal paths connecting 0 to ${A}_{1},{A}_{2},{A}_{3}$ , and ${A}_{4}$ , respectively, answer the questions in part (a).

The number of pumps in use at both a six-pump station and a four-pump station will be determined. Give the possible values for each of the following random variables:

a\. $T =$ the total number of pumps in use

b\. $X =$ the difference between the numbers in use at stations 1 and 2

c\. $U =$ the maximum number of pumps in use at either station

d\. $Z =$ the number of stations having exactly two pumps in use
