# Introduction
Relationships Between Distributions:
- **Binomial Distribution:**
	- Serves as the approximate probability model for sampling without replacement from a finite dichotomous population (successes \( S \) and failures \( F \)).
    - Applies when:
		- The sample size \( n \) is small relative to the population size \( N \).
    - Represents the number of successes \( X \) when the number of trials \( n \) is fixed.
- **Hypergeometric Distribution:**
    - Provides the exact probability model for the number of successes \( S \) in a sample drawn from a finite population.
    - Used when:
		- Sampling without replacement.
	- Both the population size \( N \) and the number of successes in the population are known.
- **Negative Binomial Distribution:**
    - Arises when the number of successes \( S \) desired is fixed, while the number of trials becomes random.
    - Focuses on the number of trials needed to achieve a specified number of successes.
- Summary of Differences:
	- **Binomial:**
	    - Fixed number of trials; counts successes.
	- **Hypergeometric:**
	    - Exact count of successes in a fixed sample from a finite population.
	- **Negative Binomial:**
	    - Fixed successes; random trials.
- Conclusion:
	- Understanding these distributions is essential for modeling different sampling scenarios in statistics, particularly in contexts of success/failure outcomes.
