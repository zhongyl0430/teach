## 3.3.2 The Expected Value of a Function 

Sometimes interest will focus on the expected value of some function
$h\left( X\right)$ rather than on just $E\left( X\right)$ .

EXAMPLE 3.21 Suppose a bookstore purchases ten copies of a book at
\$6.00 each to sell at \$12.00 with the understanding that at the end of
a 3-month period any unsold copies can be redeemed for $\$ {2.00}$ . If
$X =$ the number of copies sold, then net revenue $= h\left( X\right) =$
${12X} + 2\left( {{10} - X}\right) - {60} = {10X} - {40}$ . In this
situation, we might be interested not only in the expected number of
copies sold \[i.e., $E\left( X\right)$ \] but also in the expected net
revenue-that is, the expected value of a particular function of $X$ .

An easy way of computing the expected value of $h\left( X\right)$ is
suggested by the following example.

EXAMPLE 3.22 The cost of a certain vehicle diagnostic test depends on
the number of cylinders $X$ in the vehicle's engine. Suppose the cost
function is given by $h\left( X\right) = {20} + {3X} + {.5}{X}^{2}$ .
Since $X$ is a random variable, so is $Y = h\left( X\right)$ . The pmf
of $X$ and derived pmf of $Y$ are as follows:

$$\begin{array}{llll} x & 4 & 6 & 8 \\ p\left( x\right) & {.5} & {.3} & {.2} \end{array} \Rightarrow \frac{y}{p\left( y\right) }\;\begin{array}{lll} {40} & {56} & {76} \\ {.5} & {.3} & {.2} \end{array}$$

With ${D}^{ * }$ denoting possible values of $Y$ ,

$$E\left( Y\right) = E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{D}^{ * }}y \cdot p\left( y\right)$$

$$= \left( {40}\right) \left( {.5}\right) + \left( {56}\right) \left( {.3}\right) + \left( {76}\right) \left( {.2}\right) \tag{3.11}$$

$$= h\left( 4\right) \cdot \left( {.5}\right) + h\left( 6\right) \cdot \left( {.3}\right) + h\left( 8\right) \cdot \left( {.2}\right)$$

$$= \mathop{\sum }\limits_{D}h\left( x\right) \cdot p\left( x\right)$$

According to Equation (3.11), it was not necessary to determine the pmf
of $Y$ to obtain $E\left( Y\right)$ ; instead, the desired expected
value is a weighted average of the possible $h\left( x\right)$ (rather
than $x$ ) values.

PROPOSITION If the $\operatorname{rv}X$ has a set of possible values $D$
and $\operatorname{pmf}p\left( x\right)$ , then the expected value of
any function $h\left( X\right)$ , denoted by
$E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack$ or
${\mu }_{h\left( X\right) }$ , is computed by

$$E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{D}h\left( x\right) \cdot p\left( x\right)$$

That is, $E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack$ is computed in
the same way that $E\left( X\right)$ itself is, except that
$h\left( x\right)$ is substituted in place of $x$ .

EXAMPLE 3.23 A computer store has purchased three computers of a certain
type at $\$ {500}$ apiece. It will sell them for $\$ {1000}$ apiece. The
manufacturer has agreed to repurchase any computers still unsold after a
specified period at $\$ {200}$ apiece. Let $X$ denote the number of
computers sold, and suppose that
$p\left( 0\right) = {.1},p\left( 1\right) = {.2}$ ,
$p\left( 2\right) = {.3}$ , and $p\left( 3\right) = {.4}$ . With
$h\left( X\right)$ denoting the profit associated with

selling $X$ units, the given information implies that
$h\left( X\right) =$ revenue $- \operatorname{cost} =$
${1000X} + {200}\left( {3 - X}\right) - {1500} = {800X} - {900}$ . The
expected profit is then

$$E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack = h\left( 0\right) \cdot p\left( 0\right) + h\left( 1\right) \cdot p\left( 1\right) + h\left( 2\right) \cdot p\left( 2\right) + h\left( 3\right) \cdot p\left( 3\right)$$

$$= \left( {-{900}}\right) \left( {.1}\right) + \left( {-{100}}\right) \left( {.2}\right) + \left( {700}\right) \left( {.3}\right) + \left( {1500}\right) \left( {.4}\right)$$

$$= \$ {700}$$
