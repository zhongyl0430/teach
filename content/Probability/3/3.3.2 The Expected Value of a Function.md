Sometimes interest will focus on the expected value of some function $h\left( X\right)$ rather than on just $E\left( X\right)$ .

An easy way of computing the expected value of $h\left( X\right)$ is suggested by the following example.

[[EX 3.22 vehicle diagnostic test cost]]

> [!proposition]
> - If the $\operatorname{rv}X$ has a set of possible values $D$ and $\operatorname{pmf}p\left( x\right)$ , 
> - then the expected value of any function $h\left( X\right)$ , 
> 	- denoted by $E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack$ or ${\mu }_{h\left( X\right) }$ , 
> 	- is computed by
> $$E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{D}h\left( x\right) \cdot p\left( x\right)$$

That is, 
- $E\left\lbrack {h\left( X\right) }\right\rbrack$ is computed in the same way that $E\left( X\right)$ itself is, 
- except that $h\left( x\right)$ is substituted in place of $x$ .
