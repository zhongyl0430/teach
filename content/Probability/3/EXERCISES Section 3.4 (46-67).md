An ordinance requiring that a smoke detector be installed in all previously constructed houses has been in effect in a particular city for 1 year. The fire department is concerned that many houses remain without detectors. Let $p =$ the true proportion of such houses having detectors, and suppose that a random sample of 25 homes is inspected. If the sample strongly indicates that fewer than ${80}\%$ of all houses have a detector, the fire department will campaign for a mandatory inspection program. Because of the costliness of the program, the department prefers not to call for such inspections unless sample evidence strongly argues for their necessity. Let $X$ denote the number of homes with detectors among the 25 sampled. Consider rejecting the claim that $p \geq {.8}$ if $x \leq {15}$ .

a\. What is the probability that the claim is rejected when the actual
value of $p$ is . 8 ?

A student who is trying to write a paper for a course has a choice of two topics, A and B. If topic A is chosen, the student will order two books through interlibrary loan, whereas if topic B is chosen, the student will order four books. The student believes that a good paper necessitates receiving and using at least half the books ordered for either topic chosen. If the probability that a book ordered through interlibrary loan actually arrives in time is .9 and books arrive independently of one another, which topic should the student choose to maximize the probability of writing a good paper? What if the arrival probability is only . 5 instead of .9 ?
