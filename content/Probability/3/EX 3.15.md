EXAMPLE 3.15 Let $X =$ the number of days of sick leave taken by a
randomly selected employee of a large company during a particular year.
If the maximum number of allowable sick days per year is 14, possible
values of $X$ are $0,1,\ldots ,{14}$ . With $F\left( 0\right) = {.58}$ ,
$F\left( 1\right) = {.72},F\left( 2\right) = {.76},F\left( 3\right) = {.81},F\left( 4\right) = {.88}$
, and $F\left( 5\right) = {.94}$ ,

$$P\left( {2 \leq X \leq 5}\right) = P\left( {X = 2,3,4\text{,or }5}\right) = F\left( 5\right) - F\left( 1\right) = {.22}$$

and

$$P\left( {X = 3}\right) = F\left( 3\right) - F\left( 2\right) = {.05}$$
