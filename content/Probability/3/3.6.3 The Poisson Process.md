Application of the Poisson distribution:
- Occurrence of events over time
	- Examples of events:
		- Visits to a particular website
		- Pulses recorded by a counter
		- Email messages sent to a specific address
		- Accidents in an industrial facility
		- Cosmic ray showers observed at an observatory
Assumptions about event occurrence:
1. Parameter $\alpha > 0$:
	- For any short time interval of length $\Delta t$:
	- Probability of exactly one event:
		 - $\alpha \cdot \Delta t + o(\Delta t)$
2. Probability of more than one event during $\Delta t$:
	- $o(\Delta t)$
	- Implies probability of no events during $\Delta t$:
		- $1 - \alpha \cdot \Delta t - o(\Delta t)$
3. Independence:
	- Number of events during $\Delta t$ is independent of the number prior to this interval.
- Informal interpretation of Assumption 1:
	- Probability of a single event occurring in a short time interval is:
	- Approximately proportional to the length of the interval
	- $\alpha$ is the constant of proportionality
- Notation:
	- Let $Pk(t)$ denote Probability that $k$ events will be observed during a time interval of length $t$

> [!proposition]
> $${P}_{k}\left( t\right) = {e}^{-{at}} \cdot {\left( \alpha t\right) }^{k}/k!$$
> so that the number of events during a time interval of length $t$ is a Poisson rv with parameter $\mu = {\alpha t}$ . The expected number of events during any such time interval is then ${\alpha t}$ , so the expected number during a unit interval of time is $\alpha$ .

- The occurrence of events over time as described is called a **Poisson process**;
- the parameter $\alpha$ specifies the rate for the process.

- Observing events in space:
	- Context:
		- Instead of observing over time, consider a two- or three-dimensional region
    - Example:
		- Select a region $R$ on a map of a forest
		- Count the number of trees
        - Each tree represents an event at a particular point in space
- Assumptions:
	- Similar to assumptions 1-3 for events over time
- Result:
	- Number of events in region $R$:
	- Follows a Poisson distribution
    - Parameter: $\alpha \cdot a(R)$
		- $a(R)$ is the area of region $R$
		- $\alpha$ is the expected number of events per unit area or volume
