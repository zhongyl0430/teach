The color of pea seeds is determined by a single genetic locus. 
If the two alleles at this locus are AA or Aa (the genotype), then the pea will be yellow (the phenotype), and if the allele is aa, the pea will be green. 
Suppose we pair off 20 Aa seeds and cross the two seeds in each of the ten pairs to obtain ten new genotypes. 
Call each new genotype a success $S$ if it is aa and a failure otherwise. 
Then with this identification of $S$ and $F$ , the experiment is binomial with $n = {10}$ and $p = P$ (aa genotype). 
If each member of the pair is equally likely to contribute a or A, then 
$$p = P\left( a\right) \cdot P\left( a\right) = \left( {.5}\right) \left( {.5}\right) = {.25}$$
