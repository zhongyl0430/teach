Then $X$ , the number of failures, has a Poisson distribution with $\mu = 1$ .

b\. Determine $P\left( {X = 2}\right)$ first from the pmf formula and then from Appendix Table A.2.

c\. Determine $P\left( {2 \leq X \leq 4}\right)$ .

d\. What is the probability that $X$ exceeds its mean value by more than one standard deviation?

a. In a Poisson process, what has to happen in both the time interval $\left( {0,t}\right)$ and the interval $\left( {t,t + {\Delta t}}\right)$ so that no events occur in the entire interval $\left( {0,t + {\Delta t}}\right)$ ? Use this and Assumptions 1-3 to write a relationship between ${P}_{0}\left( {t + {\Delta t}}\right)$ and ${P}_{0}\left( t\right)$ .

b\. Use the result of part (a) to write an expression for the difference ${P}_{0}\left( {t + {\Delta t}}\right) - {P}_{0}\left( t\right)$ . Then divide by ${\Delta t}$ and let ${\Delta t} \rightarrow 0$ to obtain an equation involving $\left( {d/{dt}}\right) {P}_{0}\left( t\right)$ , the derivative of ${P}_{0}\left( t\right)$ with respect to $t$ .

c\. Verify that ${P}_{0}\left( t\right) = {e}^{-{\alpha t}}$ satisfies the equation of part (b).

d\. It can be shown in a manner similar to parts (a) and (b) that the ${P}_{k}\left( t\right) \mathrm{s}$ must satisfy the system of differential equations
$$\frac{d}{dt}{P}_{k}\left( t\right) = \alpha {P}_{k - 1}\left( t\right) - \alpha {P}_{k}\left( t\right)$$

Verify that
$${P}_{k}\left( t\right) = {e}^{-{\alpha t}}{\left( \alpha t\right) }^{k}/k!$$
satisfies the system. (This is actually the only solution.)
