- Probabilities assigned to outcomes in $\mathcal{E}$:
	- Determine probabilities associated with values of a random variable $X$
- Probability distribution of $X$:
	- Describes how total probability of 1 is distributed among possible $X$ values
> [!example]
> - Business purchases four laser printers
> 	- Let $X$ = number of printers requiring service during warranty period
> 	- Possible $X$ values:
> 		- $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$
> - Probability distribution details:
> 	- Subdivides probability of 1 among five possible values
> 	- Specifies probability associated with each $X$ value:
> 	    - $p(0)$ = probability of $X = 0$ = $P(X = 0)$
> 	    - $p(1)$ = probability of $X = 1$ = $P(X = 1)$
> 	    - And so on
> - General notation:
> 	- $p(x)$ = probability assigned to the value $x$

- Probability mass function (pmf):
	- Specifies the probability of observing each possible value $x$ of the random variable when the experiment is performed
- Required conditions for any pmf:
	- $p(x) \geq 0$
	- $\sum_{\text{all possible } x} p(x) = 1$

- Probability mass function (pmf) of $X$:
	- In the previous example, it was provided in the problem description
- Next steps:
	- Consider several examples
	    - Exploit various probability properties
	    - Obtain the desired distribution

- Name "probability mass function":
	- Suggested by a model used in physics for a system of "point masses"
- Model description:
	- Masses are distributed at various locations $x$ along a one-dimensional axis
- Role of the pmf:
	- Describes how the total probability mass of 1 is distributed:
	    - At various points along the axis of possible values of the random variable
	    - Indicates where and how much mass is located at each $x$

- Pictorial representation of a pmf:
	- Called a probability histogram
	- Similar to histograms discussed in Chapter 1
- Construction of the probability histogram:
	- Above each $y$ with $p(y) > 0$:
	    - Construct a rectangle centered at $y$
    - Height of each rectangle:
		- Proportional to $p(y)$
    - Base width:
		- Same for all rectangles
		- Often chosen as the distance between successive $y$ values (though it could be smaller)
- Example:
	- Figure 3.4 shows two probability histograms

It is often helpful to think of a pmf as specifying a mathematical model
for a discrete population.

- Population model:
	- Purpose:
		- Compute values of population characteristics
			- Example: Mean $\mu$
		- Make inferences about such characteristics
