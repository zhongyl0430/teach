- In most binomial experiments:
  - The total number of $S$'s is of interest.
    - More important than knowing which specific trials yielded $S$'s.

> [!definition]
> The binomial random variable $X$ associated with a binomial experiment consisting of $n$ trials is defined as
> $X$ := the number of $\mathrm{S}$ 's among the $n$ trials

> [!example]
> Suppose, for example, that $n = 3$ . Then there are eight possible outcomes for the experiment:
> SSS SSF SFS SFF FSS FSF FFS FFF
> 
> From the definition of$X$, $X\left( {SSF}\right) = 2$ , $X\left( {SFF}\right) = 1$ , and so on.
> Possible values for $X$ in an $n$ -trial experiment are $x = 0,1,2,\ldots ,n$ . 
> We will often write $X \sim \operatorname{Bin}\left( {n,p}\right)$ to indicate that $X$ is a binomial rv based on $n$ trials with success probability $p$ .

> [!remark] NOTATION 
> Because the pmf of a binomial rv $X$ depends on the two parameters $n$ and $p$ , we denote the pmf by $b\left( {x;n,p}\right)$ .

Consider first the case $n = 4$ for which each outcome, its probability,
and corresponding $x$ value are displayed in Table 3.1. For example,

$$P\left( {SSFS}\right) = P\left( S\right) \cdot P\left( S\right) \cdot P\left( F\right) \cdot P\left( S\right) \;\text{ (independent trials) }$$

$$= p \cdot p \cdot \left( {1 - p}\right) \cdot p\;\left( {\text{ constant }P\left( S\right) }\right)$$

$$= {p}^{3} \cdot \left( {1 - p}\right)$$

In this special case, we wish $b\left( {x;4,p}\right)$ for $x = 0,1,2,3$
, and 4 . For $b\left( {3;4,p}\right)$ , let's identify which of the 16
outcomes yield an $x$ value of 3 and sum the probabilities associated
with each such outcome:

$$b\left( {3;4,p}\right) = P\left( {FSSS}\right) + P\left( {SFSS}\right) + P\left( {SSFS}\right) + P\left( {SSSF}\right) = 4{p}^{3}\left( {1 - p}\right)$$

There are four outcomes with $X = 3$ and each has probability
${p}^{3}\left( {1 - p}\right)$ (the order of $S$ 's and $F$ 's is not
important, only the number of $S$ 's), so

$$b\left( {3;4,p}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ number of outcomes } \\ \text{ with }X = 3 \end{array}\right\} \cdot \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ probability of any particular } \\ \text{ outcome with }X = 3 \end{array}\right\}$$

Similarly, $b\left( {2;4,p}\right) = 6{p}^{2}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{2}$
, which is also the product of the number of outcomes with $X = 2$ and
the probability of any such outcome.

In general,

$$b\left( {x;n,p}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ number of sequences of } \\ \text{ length }n\text{ consisting of }x{S}^{\prime }\mathrm{s} \end{array}\right\} \cdot \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ probability of any } \\ \text{ particular such sequence } \end{array}\right\}$$

Since the ordering of $S$ 's and $F$ 's is not important, the second
factor in the previous equation is
${p}^{x}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{n - x}$ (e.g., the first $x$ trials
resulting in $S$ and the last $n - x$ resulting in $F$ ). The first
factor is the number of ways of choosing $x$ of the $n$ trials to be $S$
's-that is, the number of combinations of size $x$ that can be
constructed from $n$ distinct objects (trials here).

> [!theorem]
> $$b\left( {x;n,p}\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \left( \begin{array}{l} n \\ x \end{array}\right) {p}^{x}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{n - x} & x = 0,1,2,\ldots ,n \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.$$
