- In most binomial experiments:
	- The total number of $S$'s is of interest.
	- More important than knowing which specific trials yielded $S$'s.

> [!definition]
> The **binomial** random variable $X$ associated with a binomial experiment consisting of $n$ trials is defined as
> $X$ := the number of $\mathrm{S}$'s among the $n$ trials

> [!example]
> Suppose, for example, that $n = 3$ . 
> Then there are eight possible outcomes for the experiment:
> SSS SSF SFS SFF FSS FSF FFS FFF
> 
> From the definition of$X$, $X\left( {SSF}\right) = 2$ , $X\left( {SFF}\right) = 1$ , and so on.
> Possible values for $X$ in an $n$-trial experiment are $x = 0,1,2,\ldots ,n$ . 
> We will often write $X \sim \operatorname{Bin}\left( {n,p}\right)$ to indicate that $X$ is a binomial rv based on $n$ trials with success probability $p$ .

> [!remark] NOTATION 
> Because the pmf of a binomial rv $X$ depends on the two parameters $n$ and $p$ , we denote the pmf by $b\left( {x;n,p}\right)$ .

Consider first the case $n = 4$ for which each outcome, its probability, and corresponding $x$ value are displayed in Table 3.1. 
For example,
$$
\begin{align}
P(SSFS) &= P(S) \cdot P(S) \cdot P(F) \cdot P(S) \quad \text{(independent trials)} \\
&= p \cdot p \cdot (1 - p) \cdot p \quad (\text{constant } P(S)) \\
&= p^3 \cdot (1 - p).
\end{align}
$$

Table 3.1 
Outcomes and Probabilities for a Binomial Experiment with Four Trials

| Outcome | x   | Probability     | Outcome | x   | Probability    |
| ------- | --- | --------------- | ------- | --- | -------------- |
| SSSS    | 4   | $p^4$           | FSSS    | 3   | $p^3(1 - p)$   |
| SSSF    | 3   | $p^3(1 - p)$    | FSSF    | 2   | $p^2(1 - p)^2$ |
| SSFS    | 3   | $p^3(1 - p)$    | FSFS    | 2   | $p^2(1 - p)^2$ |
| SSFF    | 2   | $p^2(1 - p)^2$ | FSFF    | 1   | $p(1 - p)^3$   |
| SFSS    | 3   | $p^3(1 - p)$    | FFSS    | 2   | $p^2(1 - p)^2$ |
| SFSF    | 2   | $p^2(1 - p)^2$ | FFSF    | 1   | $p(1 - p)^3$   |
| SFFS    | 2   | $p^2(1 - p)^2$ | FFFS    | 1   | $p(1 - p)^3$   |
| SFFF    | 1   | $p(1 - p)^3$    | FFFF    | 0   | $(1 - p)^4$    |

In this special case, we wish $b\left( {x;4,p}\right)$ for $x = 0,1,2,3$, and 4. 
For $b\left( {3;4,p}\right)$ , let's identify which of the 16 outcomes yield an $x$ value of 3 and sum the probabilities associated with each such outcome:
$$
\begin{align}
&b\left( {3;4,p}\right) \\
= &P\left( {FSSS}\right) + P\left( {SFSS}\right) + P\left( {SSFS}\right) + P\left( {SSSF}\right) \\
= &4{p}^{3}\left( {1 - p}\right)
\end{align}
$$

There are four outcomes with $X = 3$ and each has probability ${p}^{3}\left( {1 - p}\right)$ 
- the order of $S$ 's and $F$ 's is not important, only the number of $S$ 's, 

so
$$b\left( {3;4,p}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ number of outcomes } \\ \text{ with }X = 3 \end{array}\right\} \cdot \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ probability of any particular } \\ \text{ outcome with }X = 3 \end{array}\right\}$$

Similarly, $$b\left( {2;4,p}\right) = 6{p}^{2}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{2} ,$$which is also the product of the number of outcomes with $X = 2$ and the probability of any such outcome.

In general,
$$b\left( {x;n,p}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ number of sequences of } \\ \text{ length }n\text{ consisting of }x{S}^{\prime }\mathrm{s} \end{array}\right\} \cdot \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \text{ probability of any } \\ \text{ particular such sequence } \end{array}\right\}$$

Since the ordering of $S$ 's and $F$ 's is not important, the second factor in the previous equation is $${p}^{x}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{n - x}$$
- e.g., the first $x$ trials resulting in $S$ and the last $n - x$ resulting in $F$. 

The first factor is the number of ways of choosing $x$ of the $n$ trials to be $S$'s
- that is, the number of combinations of size $x$ that can be constructed from $n$ distinct objects (trials here).

> [!theorem]
> $$b\left( {x;n,p}\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \left( \begin{array}{l} n \\ x \end{array}\right) {p}^{x}{\left( 1 - p\right) }^{n - x} & x = 0,1,2,\ldots ,n \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.$$
