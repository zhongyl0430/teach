- For the pmf of $X =$ number of courses in [[3.3 Expected Values#^tab-3-6|Table 3.6]]:
  - The population mean $\mu$ is calculated as:
    $$
    \begin{align}
    \mu &= 1 \cdot p(1) + 2 \cdot p(2) + \cdots + 7 \cdot p(7) \\
        &= (1)(0.01) + 2(0.03) + \cdots + (7)(0.02) \\
        &= 0.01 + 0.06 + 0.39 + 1.00 + 1.95 + 1.02 + 0.14 \\
        &= 4.57
    \end{align}
    $$

Interpretation:
- $\mu = 4.57$ is the **population mean**:
	- This reflects the weighted average of the possible $X$ values $1, 2, \ldots, 7$, not just a simple average.
    - The weights (probabilities) place more emphasis on certain values, particularly 4, 5, and 6, leading to a mean higher than the ordinary average of $1, \ldots, 7$ (which is 4).
- Thus, $\mu = 4.57$ reflects the distribution of the number of courses more accurately than just the midpoint of the range.
