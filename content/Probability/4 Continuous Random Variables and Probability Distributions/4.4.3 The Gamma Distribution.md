The exponential distribution results from taking $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = 1/\lambda$ .

- Figure 4.27(a) illustrates the graphs of the gamma pdf $f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ (4.8) for several $\left( {\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ pairs
- Figure 4.27(b) presents graphs of the standard gamma pdf. 

For the standard pdf, 
- when $\alpha \leq 1$, $f\left( {x;\alpha }\right)$ is strictly decreasing as $x$ increases from 0 ; 
- when $\alpha > 1, f\left( {x;\alpha }\right)$ rises from 0 at $x = 0$ to a maximum and then decreases. 

The parameter $\beta$ in (4.8) is a scale parameter, and $\alpha$ is referred to as a shape parameter because changing its value alters the basic shape of the density curve.

The mean and variance of a random variable $X$ having the gamma distribution $f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ are

$$
E\left( X\right) = \mu = {\alpha \beta }$$
$$V\left( X\right) = {\sigma }^{2} = \alpha {\beta }^{2}$$

When $X$ is a standard gamma rv, the cdf of $X$,
$$
F\left( {x;\alpha }\right) = {\int }_{0}^{x}\frac{{y}^{\alpha - 1}{e}^{-y}}{\Gamma \left( \alpha \right) }{dy}\;x > 0 \tag{4.9}
$$
is called the incomplete gamma function
- sometimes the incomplete gamma function refers to Expression (4.9) without the denominator $\Gamma \left( \alpha \right)$ in the integrand

There are extensive tables of $F\left( {x;\alpha }\right)$ available; in Appendix Table A.4, we present a small tabulation for $\alpha = 1,2,\ldots ,{10}$ and $x = 1,2,\ldots ,{15}$ .

The incomplete gamma function can also be used to compute probabilities involving nonstandard gamma distributions. These probabilities can also be obtained almost instantaneously from various software packages.
