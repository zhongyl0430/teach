Be careful here; the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are not the mean and standard deviation of $X$ but of $\ln \left( X\right)$. 
The mean and variance of $X$ can be shown to be
$$
E\left( X\right) = {e}^{\mu + {\sigma }^{2}/2}\;V\left( X\right) = {e}^{{2\mu } + {\sigma }^{2}} \cdot \left( {{e}^{{\sigma }^{2}} - 1}\right)
$$

In Chapter 5, we will present a theoretical justification for this distribution in connection with the Central Limit Theorem. 
But as with other distributions, the lognormal can be used as a model even in the absence of such justification. 
Figure 4.30 illustrates graphs of the lognormal pdf; although a normal curve is symmetric, a lognormal curve has a positive skew.

Because $\ln \left( X\right)$ has a normal distribution, the cdf of $X$ can be expressed in terms of the cdf $\Phi \left( z\right)$ of a standard normal rv $Z$.
