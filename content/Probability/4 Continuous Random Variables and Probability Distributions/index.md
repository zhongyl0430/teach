# Introduction
[[teach/Probability/3 Discrete Random Variables and Probability Distributions/index|Chapter 3]] concentrated on the development of probability distributions for discrete random variables. 
In this chapter, we consider the second general type of random variable that arises in many applied problems. 
[[4.1 Probability Density Functions]] and [[4.2 Cumulative Distribution Functions and Expected Values]] present the basic definitions and properties of continuous random variables and their probability distributions. 
In [[4.3 The Normal Distribution]], we study in detail the normal random variable and distribution, unquestionably the most important and useful in probability and statistics. 
[[4.4 The Exponential and Gamma Distributions]] and [[4.5 Other Continuous Distributions]] discuss some other continuous distributions that are often used in applied work. 
In [[4.6 Probability Plots]], we introduce a method for assessing whether given sample data is consistent with a specified distribution.
