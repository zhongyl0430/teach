For $X$ discrete, the pmf is obtained from the cdf by taking the difference between two $F\left( x\right)$ values. 
The continuous analog of a difference is a *derivative*. 
The following result is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

> [!proposition]
> If $X$ is a continuous rv with $\operatorname{pdf}f\left( x\right)$ and $\operatorname{cdf}F\left( x\right)$, then at every $x$ at which the derivative ${F}^{\prime }\left( x\right)$ exists, $${F}^{\prime }\left( x\right) = f\left( x\right) .$$
