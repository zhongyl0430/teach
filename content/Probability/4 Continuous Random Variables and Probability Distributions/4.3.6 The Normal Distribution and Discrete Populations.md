The normal distribution is often used as an approximation to the distribution of values in a discrete population. 
In such situations, extra care should be taken to ensure that probabilities are computed in an accurate manner.

[[EX 4.19 IQ]]

The correction for discreteness of the underlying distribution in Example 4.19 -that is, the addition or subtraction of .5 before standardizing- is often called a continuity correction. 
It is useful in the following application of the normal distribution to the computation of binomial probabilities.
