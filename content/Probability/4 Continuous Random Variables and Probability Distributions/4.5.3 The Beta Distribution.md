All families of continuous distributions discussed so far except for the uniform distribution have positive density over an infinite interval (though typically the density function decreases rapidly to zero beyond a few standard deviations from the mean). The beta distribution provides positive density only for $X$ in an interval of finite length.

> A random variable $X$ is said to have a beta distribution with parameters $\alpha ,\beta$ (both positive), $A$ , and $B$ if the pdf of $X$ is

> f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta , A, B}\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{B - A} \cdot \frac{\Gamma \left( {\alpha + \beta }\right) }{\Gamma \left( \alpha \right) \cdot \Gamma \left( \beta \right) }{\left( \frac{x - A}{B - A}\right) }^{\alpha - 1}{\left( \frac{B - x}{B - A}\right) }^{\beta - 1} & A \leq x \leq B \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.

Figure 4.32 illustrates several standard beta pdf's. Graphs of the general pdf are similar, except they are shifted and then stretched or compressed to fit over $\left\lbrack {A, B}\right\rbrack$ . Unless $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are integers, integration of the pdf to calculate probabilities is difficult. Either a table of the incomplete beta function or appropriate software should be used. The mean and variance of $X$ are

$$
\mu = A + \left( {B - A}\right) \cdot \frac{\alpha }{\alpha + \beta }
$$
$$
{\sigma }^{2} = \frac{{\left( B - A\right) }^{2}{\alpha \beta }}{{\left( \alpha + \beta \right) }^{2}\left( {\alpha + \beta + 1}\right) }
$$

The standard beta distribution is commonly used to model variation in the proportion or percentage of a quantity occurring in different samples, such as the proportion of a 24-hour day that an individual is asleep or the proportion of a certain element in a chemical compound.
