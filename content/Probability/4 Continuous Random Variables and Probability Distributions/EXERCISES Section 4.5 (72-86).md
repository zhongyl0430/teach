The authors of the article "A Probabilistic Insulation Life Model for Combined Thermal-Electrical Stresses” (IEEE Trans. on Elect. Insulation, 1985: 519-522) state that "the Weibull distribution is widely used in statistical problems relating to aging of solid insulating materials subjected to aging and stress." They propose the use of the distribution as a model for time (in hours) to failure of solid insulating specimens subjected to AC voltage. The values of the parameters depend on the voltage and temperature; suppose $\alpha = {2.5}$ and $\beta = {200}$ (values suggested by data in the article).

a. What is the probability that a specimen's lifetime is at most 250 ? Less than 250 ? More than 300 ?

b. What is the probability that a specimen's lifetime is between 100 and 250 ?

c. What value is such that exactly ${50}\%$ of all specimens have lifetimes exceeding that value?

Once an individual has been infected with a certain disease, let $X$ represent the time (days) that elapses before the individual becomes infectious. The article “The Probability of Containment for Multitype Branching Process Models for Emerging Epidemics" (J. of Applied Probability, 2011: 173-188) proposes a Weibull distribution with $\alpha = {2.2},\beta = {1.1}$ , and $\gamma = {.5}$ (refer to Example 4.26).

a. Calculate $P\left( {1 < X < 2}\right)$ .

b. Calculate $P\left( {X > {1.5}}\right)$ .

The article "On Assessing the Accuracy of Offshore Wind Turbine Reliability-Based Design Loads from the Environmental Contour Method" (Intl. J. of Offshore and Polar Engr., 2005: 132-140) proposes the Weibull distribution with $\alpha = {1.817}$ and $\beta = {.863}$ as a model for 1-hour significant wave height $\left( \mathrm{m}\right)$ at a certain site.

Nonpoint source loads are chemical masses that travel to the main stem of a river and its tributaries in flows that are distributed over relatively long stream reaches, in contrast to those that enter at well-defined and regulated points. The article "Assessing Uncertainty in Mass Balance Calculation of River Nonpoint Source Loads" (J. of Envir. Engr., 2008: 247-258) suggested that for a certain time period and location, $X =$ nonpoint source load of total dissolved solids could be modeled with a lognormal distribution having mean value 10,281 $\mathrm{{kg}}/$ day $/\mathrm{{km}}$ and a coefficient of variation ${CV} = {.40}({CV} =$ $\left. {{\sigma }_{X}/{\mu }_{X}}\right)$ .

b. What is the probability that $X$ is at most 15,000 $\mathrm{{kg}}/$ day $/\mathrm{{km}}$ ?

Sales delay is the elapsed time between the manufacture of a product and its sale. According to the article "Warranty Claims Data Analysis Considering Sales Delay" (Quality and Reliability Engr. Intl., 2013: 113-123), it is quite common for investigators to model sales delay using a lognormal distribution. For a particular product, the cited article proposes this distribution with parameter values $\mu = {2.05}$ and ${\sigma }^{2} = {.06}$ (here the unit for delay is months).

a. What are the variance and standard deviation of delay time?

b. What is the probability that delay time exceeds 12 months?

As in the case of the Weibull and Gamma distributions, the lognormal distribution can be modified by the introduction of a third parameter $\gamma$ such that the pdf is shifted to be positive only for $x > \gamma$ . The article cited in Exercise 4.39 suggested that a shifted lognormal distribution with shift (i.e., threshold) $= {1.0}$ , mean value $=$ 2.16, and standard deviation $= {1.03}$ would be an appropriate model for the rv $X =$ maximum-to-average depth ratio of a corrosion defect in pressurized steel.
