- Scenario Overview:
	- The bookstore purchases 10 copies of a book.
	- Cost per copy: $6.00.
	- Selling price per copy: $12.00.
	- Unsold copies can be redeemed for $2.00 each after 3 months.

- Definition of Random Variable:
	- Let $X$ represent the number of copies sold.

- Net Revenue Function:
	- The net revenue is calculated as:
    $$
    h(X) = 12X + 2(10 - X) - 60
    $$
	- Simplifying the equation:
    $$
    h(X) = 12X + 20 - 2X - 60 = 10X - 40
    $$

- Expected Values of Interest:
	- Two key expected values to consider:
	    - Expected number of copies sold: $E(X)$.
	    - Expected net revenue: $E(h(X))$.

- Calculation of Expected Net Revenue:
	- The expected net revenue can be expressed as:
    $$
    E(h(X)) = E(10X - 40) = 10E(X) - 40
    $$

- Implications:
	- Analyzing $E(X)$ provides insights into sales performance.
	- Calculating $E(h(X))$ helps assess overall profitability and financial outcomes for the bookstore.

- Conclusion:
	- Understanding both expected copies sold and expected net revenue is crucial for the bookstore's financial planning and decision-making.
