The pmf of the number $X$ of DVDs checked out was given as
- $p\left( 1\right) = {.30}$, 
- $p\left( 2\right) = {.25}$, 
- $p\left( 3\right) = {.15}$, 
- $p\left( 4\right) = {.05}$, 
- $p\left( 5\right) = {.10}$
- $p\left( 6\right) = {.15}$ ,
We have
-  $\mu = {2.85}$
- 
$$
\begin{align}
E(X^2) &= \sum_{x=1}^{6} x^2 \cdot p(x) \\
       &= (1^2)(0.30) + (2^2)(0.25) + \cdots + (6^2)(0.15) \\
       &= 11.35
\end{align}
$$

Thus ${\sigma }^{2} = {11.35} - {\left( {2.85}\right) }^{2} = {3.2275}$
as obtained previously from the definition.
