> [!definition] expected value or mean value
> - Let $X$ be a discrete random variable (rv) with:
> 	- Set of possible values $D$
> 	- Probability mass function (pmf) $p(x)$
> - The **expected value** (or **mean value**) of $X$
> 	- denoted by $E(X)$, $\mu_X$, or simply $\mu$, 
> 	- is defined as:
>   $$E(X) = \mu_X = \sum_{x \in D} x \cdot p(x)$$

- This means that the expected value is the sum of each possible value $x$ multiplied by its corresponding probability $p(x)$.
- $E(X)$ represents the "average" or "center" of the distribution of $X$.

- In Example 3.16, the expected value $\mu = 4.57$:
	- This value is not a possible value of $X$ (number of courses)
- Interpretation of "expected" value:
	- The term "expected" does not mean that we expect to see $X = 4.57$ for a single randomly selected student
    - Since $X$ represents discrete values (number of courses), a student can only register for 1, 2, 3, ..., or 7 courses, not 4.57
- The expected value $\mu$ represents the average or mean value over the entire population
	- It's a **statistical average**, not a possible individual outcome
- The concept of expected value should be interpreted with caution, especially in cases where the expected value is not a feasible outcome for individual samples.

> [!example]
> - Interpretation of $\mu$:
> 	- The mean $\mu$ can be understood as the long-run average of observed values of a random variable $X$.
> 
> - Observational process:
> 	- Consider a sequence of observations:
> 	    - First value: $x_1$
> 	    - Second value: $x_2$
> 	    - Third value: $x_3$
> 	    - And so on.
> 	- After performing this process a large number of times, compute the sample average of the observed values:
>     $$
>     \text{Sample Average} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \ldots + x_n}{n}
>     $$
> 
> - Relationship to $\mu$:
> 	- This sample average will typically be close to $\mu$ as $n$ becomes large.
> 	- Thus, $\mu$ represents the expected long-term average outcome when the experiment is performed repeatedly.
> 
> - Example:
> 	- In the context of the Apgar scores, the long-run average score is given by:
>     $$
>     \mu = 7.15
>     $$
> 	- This means that, on average, the Apgar scores of a large number of newborns will converge to $7.15$.
> 
> - Conclusion:
> 	- Understanding $\mu$ as the long-run average provides insight into the expected behavior of the random variable $X$ across many trials.
