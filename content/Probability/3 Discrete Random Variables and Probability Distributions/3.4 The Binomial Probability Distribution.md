# Introduction
Many experiments conform to the following requirements (either exactly or approximately):
1. The experiment consists of a sequence of $n$ smaller experiments (called trials):
	- $n$ is fixed in advance
1. Each trial results in one of two possible outcomes (dichotomous trials):
	- Denote outcomes as success $(S)$ and failure $(F)$
     - Assignment of $S$ and $F$ is arbitrary
2. The trials are independent:
	- The outcome of any particular trial does not influence the outcome of other trials
1. The probability of success $P(S)$ is constant from trial to trial:
	- Denote this probability by $p$

> [!definition] binomial experiment
> An experiment for which Conditions 1-4 (a fixed number of dichotomous, independent, homogenous trials) are satisfied is called a **binomial** experiment.

- [[EX 3.29 juror pool]]

We will use the following rule of thumb in deciding whether a "without-replacement" experiment can be treated as being binomial.

> [!remark]
>  - Many experiments involve a sequence of independent trials
>   - More than two possible outcomes on any one trial
> - A binomial experiment can be created by:
>   - Dividing the possible outcomes into two groups
> - Rule of thumb for treating a "without-replacement" experiment as binomial:
>   - Consider sampling without replacement from a dichotomous population of size $N$
>     - If the sample size $n$ is at most 5% of the population size, 
> 	- The experiment can be analyzed as though it were a binomial experiment

By "analyzed", we mean that probabilities based on the binomial experiment assumptions will be quite close to the actual "without-replacement" probabilities, which are typically more difficult to calculate. 
- In the first scenario of [[EX 3.29 juror pool]], 
	- $n/N = 6/{50} = {.12} > {.05}$ ,
	- so the binomial experiment is not a good approximation, 
- but in the second scenario,
	- $n/N = {10}/{500},{000} \ll {.05}$ .
