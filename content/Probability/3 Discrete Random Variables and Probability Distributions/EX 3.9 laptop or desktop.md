Consider whether the next person buying a computer at a certain electronics store buys 
- a laptop 
- or a desktop model. 
Let
$$X = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \text{ if the customer purchases a desktop computer } \\ 0 & \text{ if the customer purchases a laptop computer } \end{array}\right.$$
If ${20}\%$ of all purchasers during that week select a desktop, the pmf for $X$ is
$$
\begin{align}
p(0) &= P(X = 0) = P\text{(next customer purchases a laptop model)} = 0.8 \\
p(1) &= P(X = 1) = P\text{(next customer purchases a desktop model)} = 0.2 \\
p(x) &= P(X = x) = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad x \neq 0 \ \text{or} \ 1
\end{align}
$$

An equivalent description is
$$p\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} {.8} & \text{ if }x = 0 \\ {.2} & \text{ if }x = 1 \\ 0 & \text{ if }x \neq 0\text{ or }1 \end{array}\right.$$

Figure 3.2 is a picture of this pmf, called a *line graph*. 
- $X$ is, of course, a Bernoulli rv 
- $p\left( x\right)$ is a Bernoulli pmf.
