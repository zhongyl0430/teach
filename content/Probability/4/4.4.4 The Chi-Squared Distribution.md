## 4.4.4 The Chi-Squared Distribution

The chi-squared distribution is important because it is the basis for a number of procedures in statistical inference. The central role played by the chi-squared distribution in inference springs from its relationship to normal distributions (see Exercise 71). We'll discuss this distribution in more detail in later chapters.

DEFINITION

Let $\nu$ be a positive integer. Then a random variable $X$ is said to have a chi-squared distribution with parameter $\nu$ if the pdf of $X$ is the gamma density with $\alpha = \nu /2$ and $\beta = 2$ . The pdf of a chi-squared rv is thus

$$
f\left( {x;\nu }\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{{2}^{\nu /2}\Gamma \left( {v/2}\right) }{x}^{\left( {\nu /2}\right) - 1}{e}^{-x/2} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & x < 0 \end{matrix}\right. \tag{4.10}
$$

The parameter $\nu$ is called the number of degrees of freedom (df) of $X$ . The symbol ${\chi }^{2}$ is often used in place of "chi-squared."
