The normal, gamma (including exponential), and uniform families of distributions provide a wide variety of probability models for continuous variables, but there are many practical situations in which no member of these families fits a set of observed data very well. Statisticians and other investigators have developed other families of distributions that are often appropriate in practice.

## The Weibull Distribution

The family of Weibull distributions was introduced by the Swedish physicist Waloddi Weibull in 1939; his 1951 article "A Statistical Distribution Function of Wide Applicability" (J. of Applied Mechanics, vol. 18: 293-297) discusses a number of applications.

DEFINITION

A random variable $X$ is said to have a Weibull distribution with shape parameter $\alpha$ and scale parameter $\beta \left( {\alpha > 0,\beta > 0}\right)$ if the pdf of $X$ is

$$
f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{\alpha }{{\beta }^{\alpha }}{x}^{\alpha - 1}{e}^{-{\left( x/\beta \right) }^{\alpha }} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & x < 0 \end{matrix}\right. \tag{4.11}
$$

In some situations, there are theoretical justifications for the appropriateness of the Weibull distribution, but in many applications $f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ simply provides a good fit to observed data for particular values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . When $\alpha = 1$ , the pdf reduces to the exponential distribution (with $\lambda = 1/\beta$ ), so the exponential distribution is a special case of both the gamma and Weibull distributions. However, there are gamma distributions that are not Weibull distributions and vice versa, so one family is not a subset of the other. Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be varied to obtain a number of different-looking density curves, as illustrated in Figure 4.28.

![01925166-48c0-7eca-9860-67f13d0848b1_36_502_1700_1257_432_0.jpg](images/01925166-48c0-7eca-9860-67f13d0848b1_36_502_1700_1257_432_0.jpg)

Figure 4.28 Weibull density curves

Integrating to obtain $E\left( X\right)$ and $E\left( {X}^{2}\right)$ yields

$$
\mu = {\beta \Gamma }\left( {1 + \frac{1}{\alpha }}\right) \;{\sigma }^{2} = {\beta }^{2}\left\{ {\Gamma \left( {1 + \frac{2}{\alpha }}\right) - {\left\lbrack \Gamma \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\alpha }\right) \right\rbrack }^{2}}\right\}
$$

The computation of $\mu$ and ${\sigma }^{2}$ thus necessitates using the gamma function.

The integration ${\int }_{0}^{x}f\left( {y;\alpha ,\beta }\right) {dy}$ is easily carried out to obtain the cdf of $X$ .

The cdf of a Weibull rv having parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is

$$
F\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 & x < 0 \\ 1 - {e}^{-{\left( x/\beta \right) }^{\alpha }} & x \geq 0 \end{matrix}\right. \tag{4.12}
$$

In recent years the Weibull distribution has been used to model engine emissions of various pollutants. Let $X$ denote the amount of ${\mathrm{{NO}}}_{x}$ emission $\left( {\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{{gal}}}\right)$ from a randomly selected four-stroke engine of a certain type, and suppose that $X$ has a Weibull distribution with $\alpha = 2$ and $\beta = {10}$ (suggested by information in the article "Quantification of Variability and Uncertainty in Lawn and Garden Equipment ${\mathrm{{NO}}}_{x}$ and Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors," J. of the Air and Waste Management Assoc., 2002: 435-448). The corresponding density curve looks exactly like the one in Figure 4.28 for $\alpha = 2,\beta = 1$ except that now the values 50 and 100 replace 5 and 10 on the horizontal axis. Then

$$
P\left( {X \leq {10}}\right) = F\left( {{10};2,{10}}\right) = 1 - {e}^{-{\left( {10}/{10}\right) }^{2}} = 1 - {e}^{-1} = {.632}
$$

Similarly, $P\left( {X \leq {25}}\right) = {.998}$ , so the distribution is almost entirely concentrated on values between 0 and 25 . The value $c$ which separates the $5\%$ of all engines having the largest amounts of ${\mathrm{{NO}}}_{x}$ emissions from the remaining ${95}\%$ satisfies

$$
{.95} = 1 - {e}^{-{\left( c/{10}\right) }^{2}}
$$

Isolating the exponential term on one side, taking logarithms, and solving the resulting equation gives $c \approx {17.3}$ as the 95th percentile of the emission distribution.

In practical situations, a Weibull model may be reasonable except that the smallest possible $X$ value may be some value $\gamma$ not assumed to be zero (this would also apply to a gamma model; see Exercise 66). The quantity $\gamma$ can then be regarded as a third (threshold or location) parameter of the distribution, which is what Weibull did in his original work. For, say, $\gamma = 3$ , all curves in Figure 4.28 would be shifted 3 units to the right. This is equivalent to saying that $X - \gamma$ has the pdf (4.11), so that the cdf of $X$ is obtained by replacing $x$ in (4.12) by $x - \gamma$ .

EXAMPLE 4.26 An understanding of the volumetric properties of asphalt is important in designing mixtures which will result in high-durability pavement. The article "Is a Normal Distribution the Most Appropriate Statistical Distribution for Volumetric Properties in Asphalt Mixtures?" (J. of Testing and Evaluation, Sept. 2009: 1-11) used the analysis of some sample data to recommend that for a particular mixture, $X =$ air void volume (%) be modeled with a three-parameter Weibull distribution. Suppose the values of the parameters are $\gamma = 4,\alpha = {1.3}$ , and $\beta = {.8}$ (quite close to estimates given in the article).

For $x > 4$ , the cumulative distribution function is

$$
F\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma }\right) = F\left( {x;{1.3},{.8},4}\right) = 1 - {e}^{-{\left\lbrack \left( x - 4\right) /{.8}\right\rbrack }^{1.3}}
$$

The probability that the air void volume of a specimen is between $5\%$ and $6\%$ is

$$
P\left( {5 \leq X \leq 6}\right) = F\left( {6;{1.3},{.8},4}\right) - F\left( {5;{1.3},{.8},4}\right) = {e}^{-{\left\lbrack \left( 5 - 4\right) /{.8}\right\rbrack }^{1.3}} - {e}^{-{\left\lbrack \left( 6 - 4\right) /{.8}\right\rbrack }^{1.3}}
$$

$$
= {.263} - {.037} = {.226}
$$

Figure 4.29 shows a graph from Minitab of the corresponding Weibull density function in which the shaded area corresponds to the probability just calculated.

## The Lognormal Distribution

DEFINITION

A nonnegative rv $X$ is said to have a lognormal distribution if the rv $Y = \ln \left( X\right)$ has a normal distribution. The resulting pdf of a lognormal rv when $\ln \left( X\right)$ is normally distributed with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ is

$$
f\left( {x;\mu ,\sigma }\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }{\sigma x}}{e}^{-{\left\lbrack \ln \left( x\right) - \mu \right\rbrack }^{2}/\left( {2{\sigma }^{2}}\right) } & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & x < 0 \end{matrix}\right.
$$

Be careful here; the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are not the mean and standard deviation of $X$ but of $\ln \left( X\right)$ . The mean and variance of $X$ can be shown to be

$$
E\left( X\right) = {e}^{\mu + {\sigma }^{2}/2}\;V\left( X\right) = {e}^{{2\mu } + {\sigma }^{2}} \cdot \left( {{e}^{{\sigma }^{2}} - 1}\right)
$$

In Chapter 5, we will present a theoretical justification for this distribution in connection with the Central Limit Theorem. But as with other distributions, the lognormal can be used as a model even in the absence of such justification. Figure 4.30 illustrates graphs of the lognormal pdf; although a normal curve is symmetric, a lognormal curve has a positive skew.

Because $\ln \left( X\right)$ has a normal distribution, the cdf of $X$ can be expressed in terms of the cdf $\Phi \left( z\right)$ of a standard normal rv $Z$ .

$$
F\left( {x;\mu ,\sigma }\right) = P\left( {X \leq x}\right) = P\left\lbrack {\ln \left( X\right) \leq \ln \left( x\right) }\right\rbrack
$$

$$
= P\left( {Z \leq \frac{\ln \left( x\right) - \mu }{\sigma }}\right) = \Phi \left( \frac{\ln \left( x\right) - \mu }{\sigma }\right) \;x \geq 0 \tag{4.13}
$$

![01925166-48c0-7eca-9860-67f13d0848b1_39_673_183_818_483_0.jpg](images/01925166-48c0-7eca-9860-67f13d0848b1_39_673_183_818_483_0.jpg)

EXAMPLE 4.27 According to the article "Predictive Model for Pitting Corrosion in Buried Oil and Gas Pipelines" (Corrosion, 2009: 332-342), the lognormal distribution has been reported as the best option for describing the distribution of maximum pit depth data from cast iron pipes in soil. The authors suggest that a lognormal distribution with $\mu = {.353}$ and $\sigma = {.754}$ is appropriate for maximum pit depth $\left( \mathrm{{mm}}\right)$ of buried pipelines. For this distribution, the mean value and variance of pit depth are

$$
E\left( X\right) = {e}^{{.353} + {\left( {.754}\right) }^{2}/2} = {e}^{.6373} = {1.891}
$$

$$
V\left( X\right) = {e}^{2\left( {.353}\right) + {\left( {.754}\right) }^{2}} \cdot \left( {{e}^{{\left( {.754}\right) }^{2}} - 1}\right) = \left( {3.57697}\right) \left( {.765645}\right) = {2.7387}
$$

The probability that maximum pit depth is between 1 and $2\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ is

$$
P\left( {1 \leq X \leq 2}\right) = P\left( {\ln \left( 1\right) \leq \ln \left( X\right) \leq \ln \left( 2\right) }\right) = P\left( {0 \leq \ln \left( X\right) \leq {.693}}\right)
$$

$$
= P\left( {\frac{0 - {.353}}{.754} \leq Z \leq \frac{{.693} - {.353}}{.754}}\right) = \Phi \left( {.47}\right) - \Phi \left( {-{.45}}\right) = {.354}
$$

This probability is illustrated in Figure 4.31 (from Minitab).

![01925166-48c0-7eca-9860-67f13d0848b1_39_770_1331_616_420_0.jpg](images/01925166-48c0-7eca-9860-67f13d0848b1_39_770_1331_616_420_0.jpg)

Figure 4.31 Lognormal density curve with $\mu = {.353}$ and $\sigma = {.754}$

What value $c$ is such that only $1\%$ of all specimens have a maximum pit depth exceeding $c$ ? The desired value satisfies

$$
{.99} = P\left( {X \leq c}\right) = P\left( {Z \leq \frac{\ln \left( c\right) - {.353}}{.754}}\right)
$$

The $z$ critical value 2.33 captures an upper-tail area of ${.01}\left( {{z}_{.01} = {2.33}}\right)$ , and thus a cumulative area of .99 . This implies that

$$
\frac{\ln \left( c\right) - {.353}}{.754} = {2.33}
$$

from which $\ln \left( c\right) = {2.1098}$ and $c = {8.247}$ . Thus 8.247 is the 99th percentile of the maximum pit depth distribution.

## The Beta Distribution

All families of continuous distributions discussed so far except for the uniform distribution have positive density over an infinite interval (though typically the density function decreases rapidly to zero beyond a few standard deviations from the mean). The beta distribution provides positive density only for $X$ in an interval of finite length.

---

DEFINITION

---

A random variable $X$ is said to have a beta distribution with parameters $\alpha ,\beta$ (both positive), $A$ , and $B$ if the pdf of $X$ is

$$
f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta , A, B}\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{B - A} \cdot \frac{\Gamma \left( {\alpha + \beta }\right) }{\Gamma \left( \alpha \right) \cdot \Gamma \left( \beta \right) }{\left( \frac{x - A}{B - A}\right) }^{\alpha - 1}{\left( \frac{B - x}{B - A}\right) }^{\beta - 1} & A \leq x \leq B \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.
$$

The case $A = 0, B = 1$ gives the standard beta distribution.

Figure 4.32 illustrates several standard beta pdf's. Graphs of the general pdf are similar, except they are shifted and then stretched or compressed to fit over $\left\lbrack {A, B}\right\rbrack$ . Unless $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are integers, integration of the pdf to calculate probabilities is difficult. Either a table of the incomplete beta function or appropriate software should be used. The mean and variance of $X$ are

$$
\mu = A + \left( {B - A}\right) \cdot \frac{\alpha }{\alpha + \beta }\;{\sigma }^{2} = \frac{{\left( B - A\right) }^{2}{\alpha \beta }}{{\left( \alpha + \beta \right) }^{2}\left( {\alpha + \beta + 1}\right) }
$$

EXAMPLE 4.28 Project managers often use a method labeled PERT-for program evaluation and review technique-to coordinate the various activities making up a large project. (One successful application was in the construction of the Apollo spacecraft.) A standard assumption in PERT analysis is that the time necessary to complete any particular activity once it has been started has a beta distribution with $A =$ the optimistic time (if everything goes well) and $B =$ the pessimistic time (if everything goes badly). Suppose that in constructing a single-family house, the time $X$ (in days) necessary for laying the foundation has a beta distribution with $A = 2, B = 5,\alpha = 2$ , and $\beta = 3$ . Then $\alpha /\left( {\alpha + \beta }\right) = {.4}$ , so $E\left( X\right) = 2 + \left( 3\right) \left( {.4}\right) = {3.2}$ . For these values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , the pdf of $X$ is a simple polynomial function. The probability that it takes at most 3 days to lay the foundation is

$$
P\left( {X \leq 3}\right) = {\int }_{2}^{3}\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{4!}{1!2!}\left( \frac{x - 2}{3}\right) {\left( \frac{5 - x}{3}\right) }^{2}{dx}
$$

$$
= \frac{4}{27}{\int }_{2}^{3}\left( {x - 2}\right) {\left( 5 - x\right) }^{2}{dx} = \frac{4}{27} \cdot \frac{11}{4} = \frac{11}{27} = {.407}
$$

The standard beta distribution is commonly used to model variation in the proportion or percentage of a quantity occurring in different samples, such as the proportion of a 24-hour day that an individual is asleep or the proportion of a certain element in a chemical compound.

## EXERCISES Section 4.5 (72-86)

a. $E\left( X\right)$ and $V\left( X\right)$

b. $P\left( {X \leq 6}\right)$

c. $P\left( {{1.5} \leq X \leq 6}\right)$

(This Weibull distribution is suggested as a model for time in service in "On the Assessment of Equipment Reliability: Trading Data Collection Costs for Precision," J. of Engr: Manuf., 1991: 105-109.)

73. The authors of the article "A Probabilistic Insulation Life Model for Combined Thermal-Electrical Stresses” (IEEE Trans. on Elect. Insulation, 1985: 519-522) state that "the Weibull distribution is widely used in statistical problems relating to aging of solid insulating materials subjected to aging and stress." They propose the use of the distribution as a model for time (in hours) to failure of solid insulating specimens subjected to AC voltage. The values of the parameters depend on the voltage and temperature; suppose $\alpha = {2.5}$ and $\beta = {200}$ (values suggested by data in the article).

c. What value is such that exactly ${50}\%$ of all specimens have lifetimes exceeding that value?

74. Once an individual has been infected with a certain disease, let $X$ represent the time (days) that elapses

before the individual becomes infectious. The article “The Probability of Containment for Multitype Branching Process Models for Emerging Epidemics" (J. of Applied Probability, 2011: 173-188) proposes a Weibull distribution with $\alpha = {2.2},\beta = {1.1}$ , and $\gamma = {.5}$ (refer to Example 4.26).

78. The article "On Assessing the Accuracy of Offshore Wind Turbine Reliability-Based Design Loads from the Environmental Contour Method" (Intl. J. of Offshore and Polar Engr., 2005: 132-140) proposes the Weibull distribution with $\alpha = {1.817}$ and $\beta = {.863}$ as a model for 1-hour significant wave height $\left( \mathrm{m}\right)$ at a certain site.

79. Nonpoint source loads are chemical masses that travel to the main stem of a river and its tributaries in flows that are distributed over relatively long stream reaches, in contrast to those that enter at well-defined and regulated points. The article "Assessing Uncertainty in Mass Balance Calculation of River Nonpoint Source Loads" (J. of Envir. Engr., 2008: 247-258) suggested that for a certain time period and location, $X =$ nonpoint source load of total dissolved solids could be modeled with a lognormal distribution having mean value 10,281 $\mathrm{{kg}}/$ day $/\mathrm{{km}}$ and a coefficient of variation ${CV} = {.40}({CV} =$ $\left. {{\sigma }_{X}/{\mu }_{X}}\right)$ .

81. Sales delay is the elapsed time between the manufacture of a product and its sale. According to the article "Warranty Claims Data Analysis Considering Sales Delay" (Quality and Reliability Engr. Intl., 2013: 113-123), it is quite common for investigators to model sales delay using a lognormal distribution. For a particular product, the cited article proposes this distribution with parameter values $\mu = {2.05}$ and ${\sigma }^{2} = {.06}$ (here the unit for delay is months).

As in the case of the Weibull and Gamma distributions, the lognormal distribution can be modified by the introduction of a third parameter $\gamma$ such that the pdf is shifted to be positive only for $x > \gamma$ . The article cited in Exercise 4.39 suggested that a shifted lognormal distribution with shift (i.e., threshold) $= {1.0}$ , mean value $=$ 2.16, and standard deviation $= {1.03}$ would be an appropriate model for the rv $X =$ maximum-to-average depth ratio of a corrosion defect in pressurized steel.

86. Stress is applied to a 20-in. steel bar that is clamped in a fixed position at each end. Let $Y =$ the distance from the left end at which the bar snaps. Suppose $Y/{20}$ has a standard beta distribution with $E\left( Y\right) = {10}$ and $V\left( Y\right) = \frac{100}{7}$ .
