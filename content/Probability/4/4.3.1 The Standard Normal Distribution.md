The computation of $P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right)$ when $X$ is a normal rv with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ requires evaluating
$$
{\int }_{a}^{b}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }\sigma }{e}^{-{\left( x - \mu \right) }^{2}/\left( {2{\sigma }^{2}}\right) }{dx} \tag{4.4}
$$

None of the standard integration techniques can be used to accomplish this. Instead, for $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ , Expression (4.4) has been calculated using numerical techniques and tabulated for certain values of $a$ and $b$. 
This table can also be used to compute probabilities for any other values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ under consideration.

> The normal distribution with parameter values $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ is called the **standard normal distribution**. 
> A random variable having a standard normal distribution is called a **standard normal random variable** and will be denoted by $Z$.

> The graph of $f\left( {z;0,1}\right)$ is called the **standard normal (or $z$ ) curve**. 
> Its inflection points are at 1 and -1. 
> The cdf of $Z$ is $$P\left( {Z \leq z}\right) = {\int }_{-\infty }^{z}f\left( {y;0,1}\right) {dy} ,$$ which we will denote by $\Phi \left( z\right)$ .

The standard normal distribution almost never serves as a model for a naturally arising population. 
Instead, it is a reference distribution from which information about other normal distributions can be obtained. 
Appendix Table A. 3 gives $\Phi \left( z\right) = P\left( {Z \leq z}\right)$, the area under the standard normal density curve to the left of $z$ , for $z = - {3.49}$, $- {3.48}$, $\ldots$, ${3.48}$, ${3.49}$. 
Figure 4.14 illustrates the type of cumulative area (probability) tabulated in Table A.3. 
From this table, various other probabilities involving $Z$ can be calculated.
