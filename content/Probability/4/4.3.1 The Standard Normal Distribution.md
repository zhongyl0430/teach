## The Standard Normal Distribution

The computation of $P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right)$ when $X$ is a normal rv with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ requires evaluating

$$
{\int }_{a}^{b}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }\sigma }{e}^{-{\left( x - \mu \right) }^{2}/\left( {2{\sigma }^{2}}\right) }{dx} \tag{4.4}
$$

None of the standard integration techniques can be used to accomplish this. Instead, for $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ , Expression (4.4) has been calculated using numerical techniques and tabulated for certain values of $a$ and $b$ . This table can also be used to compute probabilities for any other values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ under consideration.

DEFINITION

---

The normal distribution with parameter values $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ is called the standard normal distribution. A random variable having a standard normal distribution is called a standard normal random variable and will be denoted by $Z$ . The pdf of $Z$ is

$$
f\left( {z;0,1}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}{e}^{-{z}^{2}/2}\; - \infty < z < \infty
$$

The graph of $f\left( {z;0,1}\right)$ is called the standard normal (or $z$ ) curve. Its inflection points are at 1 and -1 . The cdf of $Z$ is $P\left( {Z \leq z}\right) = {\int }_{-\infty }^{z}f\left( {y;0,1}\right) {dy}$ , which we will denote by $\Phi \left( z\right)$ .

The standard normal distribution almost never serves as a model for a naturally arising population. Instead, it is a reference distribution from which information about other normal distributions can be obtained. Appendix Table A. 3 gives $\Phi \left( z\right) = P\left( {Z \leq z}\right)$ , the area under the standard normal density curve to the left of $z$ , for $z = - {3.49}, - {3.48},\ldots ,{3.48},{3.49}$ . Figure 4.14 illustrates the type of cumulative area (probability) tabulated in Table A.3. From this table, various other probabilities involving $Z$ can be calculated.

EXAMPLE 4.13 Letâ€™s determine the following standard normal probabilities: (a) $P\left( {Z \leq {1.25}}\right)$ , (b) $P\left( {Z > {1.25}}\right)$ ,(c) $P\left( {Z \leq - {1.25}}\right)$ ,(d) $P\left( {-{.38} \leq Z \leq {1.25}}\right)$ , and (e) $P\left( {Z \leq 5}\right)$ .

a. $P\left( {Z \leq {1.25}}\right) = \Phi \left( {1.25}\right)$ , a probability that is tabulated in Appendix Table A. 3 at the intersection of the row marked 1.2 and the column marked .05 . The number there is .8944, so $P\left( {Z \leq {1.25}}\right) = {.8944}$ . Figure 4.15(a) illustrates this probability.

b. $P\left( {Z > {1.25}}\right) = 1 - P\left( {Z \leq {1.25}}\right) = 1 - \Phi \left( {1.25}\right)$ , the area under the $z$ curve to the right of 1.25 (an upper-tail area). Then $\Phi \left( {1.25}\right) = {.8944}$ implies that $P\left( {Z > {1.25}}\right) = {.1056}$ . Since $Z$ is a continuous rv, $P\left( {Z \geq {1.25}}\right) = {.1056}$ . See Figure 4.15(b).

c. $P\left( {Z \leq - {1.25}}\right) = \Phi \left( {-{1.25}}\right)$ , a lower-tail area. Directly from Appendix Table A. $3,\Phi \left( {-{1.25}}\right) = {.1056}$ . By symmetry of the $z$ curve, this is the same answer as in part (b).

d. $P\left( {-{.38} \leq Z \leq {1.25}}\right)$ is the area under the standard normal curve above the interval whose left endpoint is -.38 and whose right endpoint is 1.25 . From Section 4.2, if $X$ is a continuous rv with $\operatorname{cdf}F\left( x\right)$ , then $P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right) = F\left( b\right) - F\left( a\right)$ . Thus $P\left( {-{.38} \leq Z \leq {1.25}}\right) = \Phi \left( {1.25}\right) - \Phi \left( {-{.38}}\right) = {.8944} - {.3520} = {.5424}$ . (See Figure 4.16.)

Figure ${4.16P}\left( {-{.38} \leq Z \leq {1.25}}\right)$ as the difference between two cumulative areas

e. $P\left( {Z \leq 5}\right) = \Phi \left( 5\right)$ , the cumulative area under the $z$ curve to the left of 5 . This probability does not appear in the table because the last row is labeled 3.4. However, the last entry in that row is $\Phi \left( {3.49}\right) = {.9998}$ . That is, essentially all of the area under the curve lies to the left of 3.49 (at most 3.49 standard deviations to the right of the mean). Therefore we conclude that $P\left( {Z \leq 5}\right) \approx 1$ .
