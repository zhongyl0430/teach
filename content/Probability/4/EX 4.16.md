The time that it takes a driver to react to the brake lights on a decelerating vehicle is critical in helping to avoid rear-end collisions. The article "Fast-Rise Brake Lamp as a Collision-Prevention Device" (Ergonomics, 1993: 391-395) suggests that reaction time for an in-traffic response to a brake signal from standard brake lights can be modeled with a normal distribution having mean value 1.25 sec and standard deviation of .46 sec. What is the probability that reaction time is between 1.00 sec and 1.75 sec? If we let $X$ denote reaction time, then standardizing gives

$$
{1.00} \leq X \leq {1.75}
$$

if and only if

$$
\frac{{1.00} - {1.25}}{.46} \leq \frac{X - {1.25}}{.46} \leq \frac{{1.75} - {1.25}}{.46}
$$

Thus

$$
P\left( {{1.00} \leq X \leq {1.75}}\right) = P\left( {\frac{{1.00} - {1.25}}{.46} \leq Z \leq \frac{{1.75} - {1.25}}{.46}}\right)
$$

$$
= P\left( {-{.54} \leq Z \leq {1.09}}\right) = \Phi \left( {1.09}\right) - \Phi \left( {-{.54}}\right)
$$

$$
= {.8621} - {.2946} = {.5675}
$$

This is illustrated in Figure 4.22. Similarly, if we view 2 sec as a critically long reaction time, the probability that actual reaction time will exceed this value is

$$
P\left( {X > 2}\right) = P\left( {Z > \frac{2 - {1.25}}{.46}}\right) = P\left( {Z > {1.63}}\right) = 1 - \Phi \left( {1.63}\right) = {.0516}
$$
