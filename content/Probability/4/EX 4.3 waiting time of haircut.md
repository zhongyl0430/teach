Let $X$ represent the amount of time a randomly selected customer spends waiting for a haircut before his/her haircut commences. 
Your first thought might be that $X$ is a continuous random variable, since a measurement is required to determine its value. 
However, there are customers lucky enough to have no wait whatsoever before climbing into the barberâ€™s chair. 
So it must be the case that $$P\left( {X = 0}\right) > 0 .$$
Conditional on no chairs being empty, though, the waiting time will be continuous since $X$ could then assume any value between some minimum possible time $A$ and a maximum possible time $B$ . 
This random variable is neither purely discrete nor purely continuous but instead is a *mixture* of the two types.
