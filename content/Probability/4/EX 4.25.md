In recent years the Weibull distribution has been used to model engine emissions of various pollutants. Let $X$ denote the amount of ${\mathrm{{NO}}}_{x}$ emission $\left( {\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{{gal}}}\right)$ from a randomly selected four-stroke engine of a certain type, and suppose that $X$ has a Weibull distribution with $\alpha = 2$ and $\beta = {10}$ (suggested by information in the article "Quantification of Variability and Uncertainty in Lawn and Garden Equipment ${\mathrm{{NO}}}_{x}$ and Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors," J. of the Air and Waste Management Assoc., 2002: 435-448). The corresponding density curve looks exactly like the one in Figure 4.28 for $\alpha = 2,\beta = 1$ except that now the values 50 and 100 replace 5 and 10 on the horizontal axis. Then

$$
P\left( {X \leq {10}}\right) = F\left( {{10};2,{10}}\right) = 1 - {e}^{-{\left( {10}/{10}\right) }^{2}} = 1 - {e}^{-1} = {.632}
$$

Similarly, $P\left( {X \leq {25}}\right) = {.998}$ , so the distribution is almost entirely concentrated on values between 0 and 25 . The value $c$ which separates the $5\%$ of all engines having the largest amounts of ${\mathrm{{NO}}}_{x}$ emissions from the remaining ${95}\%$ satisfies

$$
{.95} = 1 - {e}^{-{\left( c/{10}\right) }^{2}}
$$

Isolating the exponential term on one side, taking logarithms, and solving the resulting equation gives $c \approx {17.3}$ as the 95th percentile of the emission distribution.
