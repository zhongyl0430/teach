The cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F\left( x\right)$ for a discrete rv $X$ gives, for any specified number $x$ , the probability $P\left( {X \leq x}\right)$. 
It is obtained by summing the $\operatorname{pmf}p\left( y\right)$ over all possible values $y$ satisfying $y \leq x$. 
The cdf of a continuous rv gives the same probabilities $P\left( {X \leq x}\right)$ and is obtained by integrating the pdf $f\left( y\right)$ between the limits $- \infty$ and $x$.
