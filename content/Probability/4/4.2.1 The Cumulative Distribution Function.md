## 4.2.1 The Cumulative Distribution Function

The cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F\left( x\right)$ for a discrete rv $X$ gives, for any specified number $x$ , the probability $P\left( {X \leq x}\right)$ . It is obtained by summing the $\operatorname{pmf}p\left( y\right)$ over all possible values $y$ satisfying $y \leq x$ . The cdf of a continuous rv gives the same probabilities $P\left( {X \leq x}\right)$ and is obtained by integrating the pdf $f\left( y\right)$ between the limits $- \infty$ and $x$ .

DEFINITION

---

The cumulative distribution function $F\left( x\right)$ for a continuous rv $X$ is defined for every number $x$ by

$$
F\left( x\right) = P\left( {X \leq x}\right) = {\int }_{-\infty }^{x}f\left( y\right) {dy}
$$

For each $x, F\left( x\right)$ is the area under the density curve to the left of $x$ . This is illustrated in Figure 4.5, where $F\left( x\right)$ increases smoothly as $x$ increases.

EXAMPLE 4.6 Let $X$ , the thickness of a certain metal sheet, have a uniform distribution on $\left\lbrack {A, B}\right\rbrack$ . The density function is shown in Figure 4.6. For $x < A, F\left( x\right) = 0$ , since there is no area under the graph of the density function to the left of such an $x$ . For $x \geq B, F\left( x\right) = 1$ , since all the area is accumulated to the left of such an $x$ . Finally, for $A \leq x \leq B,$

$$
F\left( x\right) = {\int }_{-\infty }^{x}f\left( y\right) {dy} = {\int }_{A}^{x}\frac{1}{B - A}{dy} = {\left. \frac{1}{B - A} \cdot y\right| }_{y = A}^{y = x} = \frac{x - A}{B - A}
$$

The entire cdf is

$$
F\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 & x < A \\ \frac{x - A}{B - A} & A \leq x < B \\ 1 & x \geq B \end{matrix}\right.
$$

The graph of this cdf appears in Figure 4.7.
