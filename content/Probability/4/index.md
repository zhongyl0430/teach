# Introduction
Chapter 3 concentrated on the development of probability distributions for discrete random variables. In this chapter, we consider the second general type of random variable that arises in many applied problems. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 present the basic definitions and properties of continuous random variables and their probability distributions. In Section 4.3, we study in detail the normal random variable and distribution, unquestionably the most important and useful in probability and statistics. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 discuss some other continuous distributions that are often used in applied work. In Section 4.6, we introduce a method for assessing whether given sample data is consistent with a specified distribution.
