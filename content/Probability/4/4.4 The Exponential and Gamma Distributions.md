# Introduction
The density curve corresponding to any normal distribution is bell-shaped and therefore symmetric. There are many practical situations in which the variable of interest to an investigator might have a skewed distribution. One family of distributions that has this property is the gamma family. We first consider a special case, the exponential distribution, and then generalize later in the section.
