An oocyte is a female germ cell involved in reproduction. Based on analyses of a large sample, the article "Reproductive Traits of Pioneer Gastropod Species Colonizing Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vents After an Eruption" (Marine Biology, 2011: 181-192) proposed the following mixture of normal distributions as a model for the distribution of $X =$ oocyte diameter $\left( {\mu \mathrm{m}}\right)$ :

Let $t =$ the amount of sales tax a retailer owes the government for a certain period. The article "Statistical Sampling in Tax Audits" (Statistics and the Law, 2008: 320-343) proposes modeling the uncertainty in $t$ by regarding it as a normally distributed random variable with mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ (in the article, these two parameters are estimated from the results of a tax audit involving $n$ sampled transactions). If $a$ represents the amount the retailer is assessed, then an under-assessment results if $t > a$ and an over-assessment results if $a > t$ . The proposed penalty (i.e., loss) function for over- or under-assessment is $\mathrm{L}\left( {a, t}\right) = t - a$ if $t > a$ and $= k\left( {a - t}\right)$ if $t \leq a(k > 1$ is suggested to incorporate the idea that over-assessment is more serious than under-assessment).

a. Show that ${a}^{ * } = \mu + \sigma {\Phi }^{-1}\left( {1/\left( {k + 1}\right) }\right)$ is the value of $a$ that minimizes the expected loss, where ${\Phi }^{-1}$ is the inverse function of the standard normal cdf.

The article "Statistical Behavior Modeling for Driver-Adaptive Precrash Systems” (IEEE Trans. on Intelligent Transp. Systems, 2013: 1-9) proposed the following mixture of two exponential distributions for modeling the behavior of what the authors called "the criticality level of a situation” $X$ .

$$
f\left( {x;{\lambda }_{1},{\lambda }_{2}, p}\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} p{\lambda }_{1}{e}^{-{\lambda }_{1}x} + \left( {1 - p}\right) {\lambda }_{2}{e}^{-{\lambda }_{2}x} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.

This is often called the hyperexponential or mixed exponential distribution. This distribution is also proposed as a model for rainfall amount in "Modeling Monsoon Affected Rainfall of Pakistan by Point Processes" (J. of Water Resources Planning and Mgmnt., 1992: 671-688).

Assume that $h\left( \cdot \right)$ is an invertible function, so that $y = h\left( x\right)$ can be solved for $x$ to yield $x = k\left( y\right)$ . Then it can be shown that the pdf of $Y$ is

It can then be shown that the pdf of the distance $V$ from the target to the landing point is

The article "Three Sisters Give Birth on the Same Day" (Chance, Spring 2001, 23-25) used the fact that three Utah sisters had all given birth on March 11, 1998 as a basis for posing some interesting questions regarding birth coincidences.

a. Disregarding leap year and assuming that the other 365 days are equally likely, what is the probability that three randomly selected births all occur on March 11? Be sure to indicate what, if any, extra assumptions you are making.

b. With the assumptions used in part (a), what is the probability that three randomly selected births all occur on the same day?

c. The author suggested that, based on extensive data, the length of gestation (time between conception and birth) could be modeled as having a normal distribution with mean value 280 days and standard deviation 19.88 days. The due dates for the three Utah sisters were March 15, April 1, and April 4, respectively. Assuming that all three due dates are at the mean of the distribution, what is the probability that all births occurred on March 11?

Let $X$ denote the lifetime of a component, with $f\left( x\right)$ and $F\left( x\right)$ the pdf and cdf of $X$ . The probability that the component fails in the interval $\left( {x, x + {\Delta x}}\right)$ is approximately $f\left( x\right) \cdot {\Delta x}$ . The conditional probability that it fails in $\left( {x, x + {\Delta x}}\right)$ given that it has lasted at least $x$ is $f\left( x\right) \cdot {\Delta x}/\left\lbrack {1 - F\left( x\right) }\right\rbrack$ . Dividing this by ${\Delta x}$ produces the failure rate function:

$$
r\left( x\right) = \frac{f\left( x\right) }{1 - F\left( x\right) }
$$

An increasing failure rate function indicates that older components are increasingly likely to wear out, whereas a decreasing failure rate is evidence of increasing reliability with age. In practice, a "bathtub-shaped" failure is often assumed.

a. If $X$ is exponentially distributed, what is $r\left( x\right)$ ?

b. If $X$ has a Weibull distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , what is $r\left( x\right)$ ? For what parameter values will $r\left( x\right)$ be increasing? For what parameter values will $r\left( x\right)$ decrease with $x$ ?

c. Since $r\left( x\right) = - \left( {d/{dx}}\right) \ln \left\lbrack {1 - F\left( x\right) }\right\rbrack ,\ln \left\lbrack {1 - F\left( x\right) }\right\rbrack =$ $- \int r\left( x\right) {dx}$ . Suppose

$$
r\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \alpha \left( {1 - \frac{x}{\beta }}\right) & 0 \leq x \leq \beta \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.

so that if a component lasts $\beta$ hours, it will last forever (while seemingly unreasonable, this model can be used to study just "initial wearout"). What are the cdf and pdf of $X$ ?

a. Show that $X$ has an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$ . [Hint: The cdf of $X$ is $F\left( x\right) = P\left( {X \leq x}\right)$ ; $X \leq x$ is equivalent to $U \leq$ ?]

Consider an $\operatorname{rv}X$ with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ , and let $g\left( X\right)$ be a specified function of $X$ . The first-order Taylor series approximation to $g\left( X\right)$ in the neighborhood of $\mu$ is

$$
g\left( X\right) \approx g\left( \mu \right) + {g}^{\prime }\left( \mu \right) \cdot \left( {X - \mu }\right)
$$

The right-hand side of this equation is a linear function of $X$ . If the distribution of $X$ is concentrated in an interval over which $g\left( \cdot \right)$ is approximately linear [e.g., $\sqrt{x}$ is approximately linear in $\left( {1,2}\right) \rbrack$ , then the equation yields approximations to $E\left( {g\left( X\right) }\right)$ and $V\left( {g\left( X\right) }\right)$ .

a. Give expressions for these approximations. [Hint: Use rules of expected value and variance for a linear function ${aX} + b$ .]

A function $g\left( x\right)$ is convex if the chord connecting any two points on the function's graph lies above the graph. When $g\left( x\right)$ is differentiable, an equivalent condition is that for every $x$ , the tangent line at $x$ lies entirely on or below the graph. (See the figure below.) How does $g\left( \mu \right) = g\left( {E\left( X\right) }\right)$ compare to $E\left( {g\left( X\right) }\right)$ ? [Hint: The equation of the tangent line at $x = \mu$ is $y = g\left( \mu \right) + {g}^{\prime }\left( \mu \right) \cdot \left( {x - \mu }\right)$ . Use the condition of convexity, substitute $X$ for $x$ , and take expected values. [Note: Unless $g\left( x\right)$ is linear, the resulting inequality (usually called Jensen's inequality) is strict $\left( { < \text{rather than} \leq }\right)$ ; it is valid for both continuous and discrete rv's.]

An individual's credit score is a number calculated based on that person's credit history that helps a lender determine how much he/she should be loaned or what credit limit should be established for a credit card. An article in the Los Angeles Times gave data which suggested that a beta distribution with parameters $A = {150}, B = {850}$ , $\alpha = 8,\beta = 2$ would provide a reasonable approximation to the distribution of American credit scores.

Let $V$ denote rainfall volume and $W$ denote runoff volume (both in mm). According to the article "Runoff Quality Analysis of Urban Catchments with Analytical Probability Models" (J. of Water Resource Planning and Management, 2006: 4-14), the runoff volume will be 0 if $V \leq {v}_{d}$ and will be $k\left( {V - {v}_{d}}\right)$ if $V > {v}_{d}$ .
