Mopeds (small motorcycles with an engine capacity below ${50}{\mathrm{\;{cm}}}^{3}$ ) are very popular in Europe because of their mobility, ease of operation, and low cost. The article "Procedure to Verify the Maximum Speed of Automatic Transmission Mopeds in Periodic Motor Vehicle Inspections" (J. of Automobile Engr., 2008: 1615-1623) described a rolling bench test for determining maximum vehicle speed. A normal distribution with mean value ${46.8}\mathrm{\;{km}}/\mathrm{h}$ and standard deviation ${1.75}\mathrm{\;{km}}/\mathrm{h}$ is postulated.

In a road-paving process, asphalt mix is delivered to the hopper of the paver by trucks that haul the material from the batching plant. The article "Modeling of Simultaneously Continuous and Stochastic Construction Activities for Simulation" (J. of Construction Engr. and Mgmnt., 2013: 1037-1045) proposed a normal distribution with mean value ${8.46}\mathrm{\;{min}}$ and standard deviation ${.913}\mathrm{\;{min}}$ for the rv $X =$ truck haul time.

Spray drift is a constant concern for pesticide applicators and agricultural producers. The inverse relationship between droplet size and drift potential is well known. The paper "Effects of 2,4-D Formulation and Quinclorac on Spray Droplet Size and Deposition" (Weed Technology, 2005: 1030-1036) investigated the effects of herbicide formulation on spray atomization. A figure in the paper suggested the normal distribution with mean ${1050\mu }\mathrm{m}$ and standard deviation ${150\mu }\mathrm{m}$ was a reasonable model for droplet size for water (the "control treatment") sprayed through a ${760}\mathrm{{ml}}/\mathrm{{min}}$ nozzle.

Consider babies born in the "normal" range of 37-43 weeks gestational age. Extensive data supports the assumption that for such babies born in the United States, birth weight is normally distributed with mean ${3432}\mathrm{\;g}$ and standard deviation ${482}\mathrm{\;g}$ . 
- The article "Are Babies Normal?" (The American Statistician, 1999: 298-302) analyzed data from a particular year; for a sensible choice of class intervals, a histogram did not look at all normal, but after further investigations it was determined that this was due to some hospitals measuring weight in grams and others measuring to the nearest ounce and then converting to grams. A modified choice of class intervals that allowed for this gave a histogram that was well described by a normal distribution.

a. What is the probability that the birth weight of a randomly selected baby of this type exceeds ${4000}\mathrm{\;g}$ ? Is between 3000 and ${4000}\mathrm{\;g}$ ?

b. What is the probability that the birth weight of a randomly selected baby of this type is either less than ${2000}\mathrm{\;g}$ or greater than ${5000}\mathrm{\;g}$ ?

c. What is the probability that the birth weight of a randomly selected baby of this type exceeds $7\mathrm{{lb}}$ ?

d. How would you characterize the most extreme ${.1}\%$ of all birth weights?

e. If $X$ is a random variable with a normal distribution and $a$ is a numerical constant $\left( {a \neq 0}\right)$ , then $Y = {aX}$ also has a normal distribution. Use this to determine the distribution of birth weight expressed in pounds (shape, mean, and standard deviation), and then recalculate the probability from part (c). How does this compare to your previous answer?

Chebyshev's inequality, (see Exercise 44, Chapter 3), is valid for continuous as well as discrete distributions. It states that for any number $k$ satisfying $k \geq 1, P\left( {\left| {X - \mu }\right| \geq {k\sigma }}\right) \leq 1/{k}^{2}$ (see Exercise 44 in Chapter 3 for an interpretation). Obtain this probability in the case of a normal distribution for $k = 1,2$ , and 3, and compare to the upper bound.

There is no nice formula for the standard normal cdf $\Phi \left( z\right)$ , but several good approximations have been published in articles. The following is from "Approximations for Hand Calculators Using Small Integer Coefficients" (Mathematics of Computation, 1977: 214-222). For $0 < z \leq {5.5}$

$$
P\left( {Z \geq z}\right) = 1 - \Phi \left( z\right)
$$

$$
\approx {.5}\exp \left\{ {-\left\lbrack \frac{\left( {{83z} + {351}}\right) z + {562}}{{703}/z + {165}}\right\rbrack }\right\}
$$
