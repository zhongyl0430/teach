## Nonstandard Normal Distributions

When $X \sim N\left( {\mu ,{\sigma }^{2}}\right)$ , probabilities involving $X$ are computed by "standardizing." The standardized variable is $\left( {X - \mu }\right) /\sigma$ . Subtracting $\mu$ shifts the mean from $\mu$ to zero, and then dividing by $\sigma$ scales the variable so that the standard deviation is 1 rather than $\sigma$ .

PROPOSITION

---

If $X$ has a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ , then

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu }{\sigma }
$$

has a standard normal distribution. Thus

$$
P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right) = P\left( {\frac{a - \mu }{\sigma } \leq Z \leq \frac{b - \mu }{\sigma }}\right)
$$

$$
= \Phi \left( \frac{b - \mu }{\sigma }\right) - \Phi \left( \frac{a - \mu }{\sigma }\right)
$$

$$
P\left( {X \leq a}\right) = \Phi \left( \frac{a - \mu }{\sigma }\right) \;P\left( {X \geq b}\right) = 1 - \Phi \left( \frac{b - \mu }{\sigma }\right)
$$

According to the first part of the proposition, the area under the normal $\left( {\mu ,{\sigma }^{2}}\right)$ curve that lies above the interval $\left\lbrack {a, b}\right\rbrack$ is identical to the area under the standard normal curve that lies above the interval from the standardized lower limit $\left( {a - \mu }\right) /\sigma$ to the standardized upper limit $\left( {b - \mu }\right) /\sigma$ . An illustration of the second part appears in Figure 4.21. The key idea is that by standardizing, any probability involving $X$ can be expressed as a probability involving a standard normal rv $Z$ , so that Appendix Table A. 3 can be used. The proposition can be proved by writing the cdf of $Z = \left( {X - \mu }\right) /\sigma$ as

$$
P\left( {Z \leq z}\right) = P\left( {X \leq {\sigma z} + \mu }\right) = {\int }_{-\infty }^{{\sigma z} + \mu }f\left( {x;\mu ,\sigma }\right) {dx}
$$

Using a result from calculus, this integral can be differentiated with respect to $z$ to yield the desired $\operatorname{pdf}f\left( {z;0,1}\right)$ .

EXAMPLE 4.16 The time that it takes a driver to react to the brake lights on a decelerating vehicle is critical in helping to avoid rear-end collisions. The article "Fast-Rise Brake Lamp as a Collision-Prevention Device" (Ergonomics, 1993: 391-395) suggests that reaction time for an in-traffic response to a brake signal from standard brake lights can be modeled with a normal distribution having mean value 1.25 sec and standard deviation of .46 sec. What is the probability that reaction time is between 1.00 sec and 1.75 sec? If we let $X$ denote reaction time, then standardizing gives

$$
{1.00} \leq X \leq {1.75}
$$

if and only if

$$
\frac{{1.00} - {1.25}}{.46} \leq \frac{X - {1.25}}{.46} \leq \frac{{1.75} - {1.25}}{.46}
$$

Thus

$$
P\left( {{1.00} \leq X \leq {1.75}}\right) = P\left( {\frac{{1.00} - {1.25}}{.46} \leq Z \leq \frac{{1.75} - {1.25}}{.46}}\right)
$$

$$
= P\left( {-{.54} \leq Z \leq {1.09}}\right) = \Phi \left( {1.09}\right) - \Phi \left( {-{.54}}\right)
$$

$$
= {.8621} - {.2946} = {.5675}
$$

This is illustrated in Figure 4.22. Similarly, if we view 2 sec as a critically long reaction time, the probability that actual reaction time will exceed this value is

$$
P\left( {X > 2}\right) = P\left( {Z > \frac{2 - {1.25}}{.46}}\right) = P\left( {Z > {1.63}}\right) = 1 - \Phi \left( {1.63}\right) = {.0516}
$$

Standardizing amounts to nothing more than calculating a distance from the mean value and then reexpressing the distance as some number of standard deviations. Thus, if $\mu = {100}$ and $\sigma = {15}$ , then $x = {130}$ corresponds to $z = \left( {{130} - {100}}\right) /{15} =$ ${30}/{15} = {2.00}$ . That is,130 is 2 standard deviations above (to the right of) the mean value. Similarly, standardizing ${85}$ gives $\left( {{85} - {100}}\right) /{15} = - {1.00}$ , so 85 is 1 standard deviation below the mean. The $z$ table applies to any normal distribution provided that we think in terms of number of standard deviations away from the mean value.

EXAMPLE 4.17 The breakdown voltage of a randomly chosen diode of a particular type is known to be normally distributed. What is the probability that a diode's breakdown voltage is within 1 standard deviation of its mean value? This question can be answered without knowing either $\mu$ or $\sigma$ , as long as the distribution is known to be normal; the answer is the same for any normal distribution:

$P\left( {X\text{is within 1 standard deviation of its mean}}\right) = P\left( {\mu - \sigma \leq X \leq \mu + \sigma }\right)$

$$
= P\left( {\frac{\mu - \sigma - \mu }{\sigma } \leq Z \leq \frac{\mu + \sigma - \mu }{\sigma }}\right)
$$

$$
= P\left( {-{1.00} \leq Z \leq {1.00}}\right)
$$

$$
= \Phi \left( {1.00}\right) - \Phi \left( {-{1.00}}\right) = {.6826}
$$

The probability that $X$ is within 2 standard deviations of its mean is $P\left( {-{2.00} \leq Z \leq {2.00}}\right) = {.9544}$ and within 3 standard deviations of the mean is $P\left( {-{3.00} \leq Z \leq {3.00}}\right) = {.9974}$ .

The results of Example 4.17 are often reported in percentage form and referred to as the empirical rule (because empirical evidence has shown that histograms of real data can very frequently be approximated by normal curves).

If the population distribution of a variable is (approximately) normal, then

1. Roughly ${68}\%$ of the values are within $1\mathrm{{SD}}$ of the mean.

2. Roughly ${95}\%$ of the values are within $2\mathrm{{SDs}}$ of the mean.

3. Roughly ${99.7}\%$ of the values are within $3\mathrm{{SDs}}$ of the mean.

It is indeed unusual to observe a value from a normal population that is much farther than 2 standard deviations from $\mu$ . These results will be important in the development of hypothesis-testing procedures in later chapters.
