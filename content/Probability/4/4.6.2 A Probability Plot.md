## 4.6.2 A Probability Plot
Suppose now that for percentages ${100}\left( {i - {.5}}\right) /n\left( {i = 1,\ldots , n}\right)$ the percentiles are determined for a specified population distribution whose plausibility is being investigated. If the sample was actually selected from the specified distribution, the sample percentiles (ordered sample observations) should be reasonably close to the corresponding population distribution percentiles. That is, for $i = 1,2,\ldots , n$ there should be reasonable agreement between the $i$ th smallest sample observation and the $\left\lbrack {{100}\left( {i - {.5}}\right) /n}\right\rbrack$ th percentile for the specified distribution. Let’s consider the (population percentile, sample percentile) pairs-that is, the pairs

$$
\left( \begin{array}{ll} \left\lbrack {{100}\left( {i - {.5}}\right) /n}\right\rbrack \text{ th percentile }, & i\text{ th smallest sample } \\ \text{ of the distribution,} & \text{ observation } \end{array}\right)
$$

for $i = 1,\ldots , n$ . Each such pair can be plotted as a point on a two-dimensional coordinate system. If the sample percentiles are close to the corresponding population distribution percentiles, the first number in each pair will be roughly equal to the second number. The plotted points will then fall close to a ${45}^{ \circ }$ line. Substantial deviations of the plotted points from a ${45}^{ \circ }$ line cast doubt on the assumption that the distribution under consideration is the correct one.

Example 4.29 The value of a certain physical constant is known to an experimenter. The experimenter makes $n = {10}$ independent measurements of this value using a particular measurement device and records the resulting measurement errors (error $=$ observed value - true value). These observations appear in the accompanying table.

<table><thead><tr><th>Percentage</th><th>5</th><th>15</th><th>25</th><th>35</th><th>45</th></tr></thead><tr><td>z percentile</td><td>$- {1.645}$</td><td>$- {1.037}$</td><td>$- {.675}$</td><td>$- {.385}$</td><td>$- {.126}$</td></tr><tr><td>Sample observation</td><td>–1.91</td><td>$- {1.25}$</td><td>$- {.75}$</td><td>– .53</td><td>.20</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage</td><td>55</td><td>65</td><td>75</td><td>85</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>z percentile</td><td>.126</td><td>.385</td><td>.675</td><td>1.037</td><td>1.645</td></tr><tr><td>Sample observation</td><td>.35</td><td>.72</td><td>.87</td><td>1.40</td><td>1.56</td></tr></table>

Is it plausible that the random variable measurement error has a standard normal distribution? The needed standard normal $\left( z\right)$ percentiles are also displayed in the table. Thus the points in the probability plot are $\left( {-{1.645}, - {1.91}}\right) ,\left( {-{1.037}, - {1.25}}\right) ,\ldots$ , and $\left( {{1.645},{1.56}}\right)$ . Figure 4.33 shows the resulting plot. Although the points deviate a bit from the ${45}^{ \circ }$ line, the predominant impression is that this line fits the points very well. The plot suggests that the standard normal distribution is a reasonable probability model for measurement error.

Figure 4.33 Plot of pairs ( $z$ percentile, observed value) for the data of Example 4.29

Figure 4.34 shows a plot of pairs ( $z$ percentile, observation) for a second sample of ten observations. The ${45}^{ \circ }$ line gives a good fit to the middle part of the sample but not to the extremes. The plot has a well-defined S-shaped appearance. The two smallest sample observations are considerably larger than the corresponding $z$ , percentiles (the points on the far left of the plot are well above the ${45}^{ \circ }$ line). Similarly, the two largest sample observations are much smaller than the associated $z$ percentiles. This plot indicates that the standard normal distribution would not be a plausible choice for the probability model that gave rise to these observed measurement errors.

An investigator is typically not interested in knowing just whether a particular probability distribution, such as the standard normal distribution (normal with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ ) or the exponential distribution with $\lambda = {.1}$ , is a plausible model for the population distribution from which the sample was selected. Instead, the issue is whether some member of a family of probability distributions specifies a plausible model-the family of normal distributions, the family of exponential distributions, the family of Weibull distributions, and so on. The values of the parameters of a distribution are usually not specified at the outset. If the family of Weibull distributions is under consideration as a model for lifetime data, are there any values of the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for which the corresponding Weibull distribution gives a good fit to the data? Fortunately, it is frequently the case that just one probability plot will suffice for assessing the plausibility of an entire family. If the plot deviates substantially from a straight line, no member of the family is plausible. When the plot is quite straight, further work is necessary to estimate values of the parameters that yield the most reasonable distribution of the specified type.

Let's focus on a plot for checking normality. Such a plot is useful in applied work because many formal statistical procedures give accurate inferences only when the population distribution is at least approximately normal. These procedures should generally not be used if the normal probability plot shows a very pronounced departure from linearity. The key to constructing an omnibus normal probability plot is the relationship between standard normal $\left( z\right)$ percentiles and those for any other normal distribution:

$$
\text{normal}\left( {\mu ,\sigma }\right) \text{percentile} = \mu + \sigma \cdot \text{(corresponding}z\text{percentile)}
$$

Consider first the case $\mu = 0$ . If each observation is exactly equal to the corresponding normal percentile for some value of $\sigma$ , the pairs $(\sigma \cdot \lbrack z$ percentile], observation) fall on a ${45}^{ \circ }$ line, which has slope 1 . This then implies that the ( $z$ percentile, observation) pairs fall on a line passing through $\left( {0,0}\right)$ (i.e., one with $y$ -intercept 0) but having slope $\sigma$ rather than 1 . The effect of a nonzero value of $\mu$ is simply to change the $y$ -intercept from 0 to $\mu$ .
