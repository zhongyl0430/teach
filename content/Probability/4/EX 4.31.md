The accompanying observations are on lifetime (in hours) of power apparatus insulation when thermal and electrical stress acceleration were fixed at particular values (â€œOn the Estimation of Life of Power Apparatus Insulation Under Combined Electrical and Thermal Stress," IEEE Trans. on Electrical Insulation, 1985: 70-78). A Weibull probability plot necessitates first computing the 5th, 15th, . . . , and 95th percentiles of the standard extreme value distribution. The $\left( {100p}\right)$ th percentile $\eta \left( p\right)$ satisfies

$$
p = F\left( {\eta \left( p\right) }\right) = 1 - {e}^{-{e}^{\eta \left( p\right) }}
$$

from which $\eta \left( p\right) = \ln \left\lbrack {-\ln \left( {1 - p}\right) }\right\rbrack$ .

| Percentile | -2.97  | -1.82  | -1.25  | -0.84  | -0.51  |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| \( x \)    |  282   |  501   |  741   |  851   |  1072  |
| \( \ln(x) \) | 5.64  | 6.22   | 6.61   | 6.75   |  6.98  |

| Percentile | -0.23  |  0.05  |  0.33  |  0.64  |  1.10  |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| \( x \)    |  1122  |  1202  |  1585  |  1905  |  2138  |
| \( \ln(x) \) |  7.02  |  7.09  |  7.37  |  7.55  |  7.67  |

The pairs $\left( {-{2.97},{5.64}}\right) ,\left( {-{1.82},{6.22}}\right) ,\ldots ,\left( {{1.10},{7.67}}\right)$ are plotted as points in Figure 4.38. The straightness of the plot argues strongly for using the Weibull distribution as a model for insulation life, a conclusion also reached by the author of the cited article.
