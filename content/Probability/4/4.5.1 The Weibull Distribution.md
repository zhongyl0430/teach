The family of Weibull distributions was introduced by the Swedish physicist Waloddi Weibull in 1939; his 1951 article "A Statistical Distribution Function of Wide Applicability" (J. of Applied Mechanics, vol. 18: 293-297) discusses a number of applications.

> [!defintion]
> A random variable $X$ is said to have a Weibull distribution with shape parameter $\alpha$ and scale parameter $\beta \left( {\alpha > 0,\beta > 0}\right)$ if the pdf of $X$ is

> f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{\alpha }{{\beta }^{\alpha }}{x}^{\alpha - 1}{e}^{-{\left( x/\beta \right) }^{\alpha }} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & x < 0 \end{matrix}\right. \tag{4.11}
> $$

In some situations, there are theoretical justifications for the appropriateness of the Weibull distribution, but in many applications $f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ simply provides a good fit to observed data for particular values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . When $\alpha = 1$ , the pdf reduces to the exponential distribution (with $\lambda = 1/\beta$ ), so the exponential distribution is a special case of both the gamma and Weibull distributions. However, there are gamma distributions that are not Weibull distributions and vice versa, so one family is not a subset of the other. Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be varied to obtain a number of different-looking density curves, as illustrated in Figure 4.28.

Integrating to obtain $E\left( X\right)$ and $E\left( {X}^{2}\right)$ yields
$$
\mu = {\beta \Gamma }\left( {1 + \frac{1}{\alpha }}\right)$$
$${\sigma }^{2} = {\beta }^{2}\left\{ {\Gamma \left( {1 + \frac{2}{\alpha }}\right) - {\left\lbrack \Gamma \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\alpha }\right) \right\rbrack }^{2}}\right\}
$$

The computation of $\mu$ and ${\sigma }^{2}$ thus necessitates using the gamma function.

The integration ${\int }_{0}^{x}f\left( {y;\alpha ,\beta }\right) {dy}$ is easily carried out to obtain the cdf of $X$ .

In practical situations, a Weibull model may be reasonable except that the smallest possible $X$ value may be some value $\gamma$ not assumed to be zero (this would also apply to a gamma model; see Exercise 66). The quantity $\gamma$ can then be regarded as a third (threshold or location) parameter of the distribution, which is what Weibull did in his original work. For, say, $\gamma = 3$ , all curves in Figure 4.28 would be shifted 3 units to the right. This is equivalent to saying that $X - \gamma$ has the pdf (4.11), so that the cdf of $X$ is obtained by replacing $x$ in (4.12) by $x - \gamma$ .
