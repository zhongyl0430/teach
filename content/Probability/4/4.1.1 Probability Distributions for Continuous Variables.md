Suppose the variable $X$ of interest is the depth of a lake at a randomly chosen point on the surface. 
Let $M =$ the maximum depth (in meters), so that any number in the interval $\left\lbrack {0, M}\right\rbrack$ is a possible value of $X$ . 
If we "discretize" $X$ by measuring depth to the nearest meter, then possible values are nonnegative integers less than or equal to $M$. 
The resulting discrete distribution of depth can be pictured using a probability histogram. 
If we draw the histogram so that the area of the rectangle above any possible integer $k$ is the proportion of the lake whose depth is (to the nearest meter) $k$ , then the total area of all rectangles is 1. 
A possible histogram appears in Figure 4.1(a).

If depth is measured much more accurately and the same measurement axis as in Figure 4.1(a) is used, each rectangle in the resulting probability histogram is much narrower, though the total area of all rectangles is still 1. 
A possible histogram is pictured in Figure 4.1(b); it has a much smoother appearance than the histogram in Figure 4.1(a). 
If we continue in this way to measure depth more and more finely, the resulting sequence of histograms approaches a smooth curve, such as is pictured in Figure 4.1(c). 
Because for each histogram the total area of all rectangles equals 1, the total area under the smooth curve is also 1. 
The probability that the depth at a randomly chosen point is between $a$ and $b$ is just the area under the smooth curve between $a$ and $b$. 
It is exactly a smooth curve of the type pictured in Figure 4.1(c) that specifies a continuous probability distribution.

For $f\left( x\right)$ to be a legitimate pdf, it must satisfy the following two conditions:
1. $f\left( x\right) \geq 0$ for all $x$
2. $$\begin{align} &{\int}_{-\infty }^{\infty }f\left( x\right) {dx} \\ &= \text{area under the entire graph of } f\left( x\right) \\ &= 1 \end{align}$$

Because whenever $0 \leq a \leq b \leq {360}$ in [[EX 4.4 probability of angle]], $P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right)$ depends only on the width $b - a$ of the interval, $X$ is said to have a uniform distribution.

> [!definition] uniform distribution
> A continuous rv $X$ is said to have a **uniform distribution** on the interval $\left\lbrack {A, B}\right\rbrack$ if the pdf of $X$ is
> $$
> f\left( {x;A, B}\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{B - A} & A \leq x \leq B \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.
> $$

The graph of any uniform pdf looks like the graph in [[EX 4.4 probability of angle#^fig-4-3|Figure 4.3]] except that the interval of positive density is $\left\lbrack {A, B}\right\rbrack$ rather than $\left\lbrack {0,{360}}\right\rbrack$ .

In the discrete case, a probability mass function (pmf) tells us how little "blobs" of probability mass of various magnitudes are distributed along the measurement axis. 
In the continuous case, probability density is "smeared" in a continuous fashion along the interval of possible values. 
When density is smeared uniformly over the interval, a uniform pdf, as in [[EX 4.4 probability of angle#^fig-4-3|Figure 4.3]], results.

When $X$ is a discrete random variable, each possible value is assigned *positive* probability. 
This is not true of a continuous random variable (that is, the second condition of the definition is satisfied) because the area under a density curve that lies above any single value is zero:
$$
\begin{align}
    P(X = c) &= \int_{c}^{c} f(x) \, dx \\
    &= \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_{c - \varepsilon}^{c + \varepsilon} f(x) \, dx \\
    &= 0
\end{align}
$$

The fact that $P\left( {X = c}\right) = 0$ when $X$ is continuous has an important practical consequence: The probability that $X$ lies in some interval between $a$ and $b$ does not depend on whether the lower limit $a$ or the upper limit $b$ is included in the probability calculation:
$$
\begin{align}
    P\left( a \leq X \leq b \right) &= P\left( a < X < b \right) \\
    &= P\left( a < X \leq b \right) \\
    &= P\left( a \leq X < b \right) \tag{4.1}
\end{align}
$$

If $X$ is discrete and both $a$ and $b$ are possible values (e.g., $X$ is binomial with $n = {20}$ and $a = 5, b = {10}$ ), then all four of the probabilities in (4.1) are different.

The zero probability condition has a physical analog. 
Consider a solid circular rod with cross-sectional area $= 1{\mathrm{{in}}}^{2}$ . 
Place the rod alongside a measurement axis and suppose that the density of the rod at any point $x$ is given by the value $f\left( x\right)$ of a density function. 
Then 
- if the rod is sliced at points $a$ and $b$ and this segment is removed, the amount of mass removed is ${\int }_{a}^{b}f\left( x\right) {dx}$; 
- if the rod is sliced just at the point $c$ , no mass is removed. 
Mass is assigned to interval segments of the rod but not to individual points.

Unlike discrete distributions such as the binomial, hypergeometric, and negative binomial, the distribution of any given continuous rv cannot usually be derived using simple probabilistic arguments. 
Instead, one must make a judicious choice of pdf based on prior knowledge and available data. 
Fortunately, there are some general families of pdf's that have been found to be sensible candidates in a wide variety of experimental situations; several of these are discussed later in the chapter.

Just as in the discrete case, it is often helpful to think of the population of interest as consisting of $X$ values rather than individuals or objects. 
The pdf is then a model for the distribution of values in this numerical population, and from this model various population characteristics (such as the mean) can be calculated.
