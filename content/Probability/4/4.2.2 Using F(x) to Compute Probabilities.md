The importance of the cdf here, just as for discrete rv's, is that probabilities of various intervals can be computed from a formula for or table of $F\left( x\right)$ .

Figure 4.8 illustrates the second part of this proposition; the desired probability is the shaded area under the density curve between $a$ and $b$ , and it equals the difference between the two shaded cumulative areas. This is different from what is appropriate for a discrete integer-valued random variable (e.g., binomial or Poisson): $P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right) = F\left( b\right) - F\left( {a - 1}\right)$ when $a$ and $b$ are integers.

Once the cdf has been obtained, any probability involving $X$ can easily be calculated without any further integration.
