The article "The Probability Distribution of Maintenance Cost of a System Affected by the Gamma Process of Degradation" (Reliability Engr. and System Safety, 2012: 65-76) notes that the gamma distribution is widely used to model the extent of degradation such as corrosion, creep, or wear. Let $X$ represent the amount of degradation of a certain type, and suppose that it has a standard gamma distribution with $\alpha = 2$ . Since

$$
P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right) = F\left( b\right) - F\left( a\right)
$$

when $X$ is continuous,

$$
P\left( {3 \leq X \leq 5}\right) = F\left( {5;2}\right) - F\left( {3;2}\right) = {.960} - {.801} = {.159}
$$

The probability that the amount of degradation exceeds 4 is

$$
P\left( {X > 4}\right) = 1 - P\left( {X \leq 4}\right) = 1 - F\left( {4;2}\right) = 1 - {.908} = {.092}
$$
