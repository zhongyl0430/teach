Suppose that calls to a rape crisis center in a certain county occur according to a Poisson process with rate $\alpha = {.5}$ call per day. Then the number of days $X$ between successive calls has an exponential distribution with parameter value .5 , so the probability that more than 2 days elapse between calls is

$$
P\left( {X > 2}\right) = 1 - P\left( {X \leq 2}\right) = 1 - F\left( {2;{.5}}\right) = {e}^{-\left( {.5}\right) \left( 2\right) } = {.368}
$$

The expected time between successive calls is $1/{.5} = 2$ days.
