## Percentiles of an Arbitrary Normal Distribution

The $\left( {100p}\right)$ th percentile of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is easily related to the $\left( {100p}\right)$ th percentile of the standard normal distribution.

PROPOSITION

$$
\begin{matrix} \left( {100p}\right) \text{ th percentile } \\ \text{ for normal }\left( {\mu ,\sigma }\right) \end{matrix} = \mu + \left\lbrack \begin{matrix} \left( {100p}\right) \text{ th for } \\ \text{ standard normal } \end{matrix}\right\rbrack \cdot \sigma
$$

Another way of saying this is that if $z$ is the desired percentile for the standard normal distribution, then the desired percentile for the normal $\left( {\mu ,\sigma }\right)$ distribution is $z$ standard deviations from $\mu$ .

EXAMPLE 4.18 The authors of "Assessment of Lifetime of Railway Axle" (Intl. J. of Fatigue, 2013: 40-46) used data collected from an experiment with a specified initial crack length and number of loading cycles to propose a normal distribution with mean value ${5.496}\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ and standard deviation ${.067}\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ for the rv $X =$ final crack depth. For this model, what value of final crack depth would be exceeded by only ${.5}\%$ of all cracks under these circumstances? Let $c$ denote the requested value. Then the desired condition is that $P\left( {X > c}\right) = {.005}$ , or, equivalently, that $P\left( {X \leq c}\right) = {.995}$ . Thus $c$ is the 99.5th percentile of the normal distribution with $\mu = {5.496}$ and $\sigma = {.067}$ . The 99.5th percentile of the standard normal distribution is 2.58 , so

$$
c = \eta \left( {.995}\right) = {5.496} + \left( {2.58}\right) \left( {.067}\right) = {5.496} + {.173} = {5.669}\mathrm{\;{mm}}
$$

This is illustrated in Figure 4.23.
