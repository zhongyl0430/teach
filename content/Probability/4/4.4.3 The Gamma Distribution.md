## 4.4.3 The Gamma Distribution

DEFINITION

A continuous random variable $X$ is said to have a gamma distribution if the pdf of $X$ is

$$
f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{{\beta }^{\alpha }\Gamma \left( \alpha \right) }{x}^{\alpha - 1}{e}^{-x/\beta } & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right. \tag{4.8}
$$

where the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfy $\alpha > 0,\beta > 0$ . The standard gamma distribution has $\beta = 1$ , so the pdf of a standard gamma rv is given by (4.7).

The exponential distribution results from taking $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = 1/\lambda$ .

Figure 4.27(a) illustrates the graphs of the gamma pdf $f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ (4.8) for several $\left( {\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ pairs, whereas Figure 4.27(b) presents graphs of the standard gamma pdf. For the standard pdf, when $\alpha \leq 1, f\left( {x;\alpha }\right)$ is strictly decreasing as $x$ increases from 0 ; when $\alpha > 1, f\left( {x;\alpha }\right)$ rises from 0 at $x = 0$ to a maximum and then decreases. The parameter $\beta$ in (4.8) is a scale parameter, and $\alpha$ is referred to as a shape parameter because changing its value alters the basic shape of the density curve.

The mean and variance of a random variable $X$ having the gamma distribution $f\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right)$ are

$$
E\left( X\right) = \mu = {\alpha \beta }\;V\left( X\right) = {\sigma }^{2} = \alpha {\beta }^{2}
$$

When $X$ is a standard gamma rv, the cdf of $X$ ,

$$
F\left( {x;\alpha }\right) = {\int }_{0}^{x}\frac{{y}^{\alpha - 1}{e}^{-y}}{\Gamma \left( \alpha \right) }{dy}\;x > 0 \tag{4.9}
$$

is called the incomplete gamma function [sometimes the incomplete gamma function refers to Expression (4.9) without the denominator $\Gamma \left( \alpha \right)$ in the integrand]. There are extensive tables of $F\left( {x;\alpha }\right)$ available; in Appendix Table A.4, we present a small tabulation for $\alpha = 1,2,\ldots ,{10}$ and $x = 1,2,\ldots ,{15}$ .

EXAMPLE 4.23 The article "The Probability Distribution of Maintenance Cost of a System Affected by the Gamma Process of Degradation" (Reliability Engr. and System Safety, 2012: 65-76) notes that the gamma distribution is widely used to model the extent of degradation such as corrosion, creep, or wear. Let $X$ represent the amount of degradation of a certain type, and suppose that it has a standard gamma distribution with $\alpha = 2$ . Since

$$
P\left( {a \leq X \leq b}\right) = F\left( b\right) - F\left( a\right)
$$

when $X$ is continuous,

$$
P\left( {3 \leq X \leq 5}\right) = F\left( {5;2}\right) - F\left( {3;2}\right) = {.960} - {.801} = {.159}
$$

The probability that the amount of degradation exceeds 4 is

$$
P\left( {X > 4}\right) = 1 - P\left( {X \leq 4}\right) = 1 - F\left( {4;2}\right) = 1 - {.908} = {.092}
$$

The incomplete gamma function can also be used to compute probabilities involving nonstandard gamma distributions. These probabilities can also be obtained almost instantaneously from various software packages.

PROPOSITION Let $X$ have a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . Then for any $x > 0$ , the cdf of $X$ is given by

$$
P\left( {X \leq x}\right) = F\left( {x;\alpha ,\beta }\right) = F\left( {\frac{x}{\beta };\alpha }\right)
$$

where $F\left( {\cdot ;\alpha }\right)$ is the incomplete gamma function.

EXAMPLE 4.24 Suppose the survival time $X$ in weeks of a randomly selected male mouse exposed to 240 rads of gamma radiation has (what else!) a gamma distribution with $\alpha = 8$ and $\beta = {15}$ . (Data in Survival Distributions: Reliability Applications in the Biomedical Services, by A. J. Gross and V. Clark, suggests $\alpha \approx {8.5}$ and $\beta \approx {13.3}$ .) The expected survival time is $E\left( X\right) = \left( 8\right) \left( {15}\right) = {120}$ weeks, whereas $V\left( X\right) = \left( 8\right) {\left( {15}\right) }^{2} = {1800}$ and ${\sigma }_{X} = \sqrt{1800} = {42.43}$ weeks. The probability that a mouse survives between 60 and 120 weeks is

$$
P\left( {{60} \leq X \leq {120}}\right) = P\left( {X \leq {120}}\right) - P\left( {X \leq {60}}\right)
$$

$$
= F\left( {{120}/{15};8}\right) - F\left( {{60}/{15};8}\right)
$$

$$
= F\left( {8;8}\right) - F\left( {4;8}\right) = {.547} - {.051} = {.496}
$$

The probability that a mouse survives at least 30 weeks is

$$
P\left( {X \geq {30}}\right) = 1 - P\left( {X < {30}}\right) = 1 - P\left( {X \leq {30}}\right)
$$

$$
= 1 - F\left( {{30}/{15};8}\right) = {.999}
$$
