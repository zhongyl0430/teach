When $X$ has a uniform distribution, $F\left( x\right)$ is differentiable except at $x = A$ and $x = B$, where the graph of $F\left( x\right)$ has sharp corners. 
Since $F\left( x\right) = 0$ for $x < A$ and $F\left( x\right) = 1$ for $x > B$, ${F}^{\prime }\left( x\right) = 0 = f\left( x\right)$ for such $x$. 
For $A < x < B$ ,
$$
{F}^{\prime }\left( x\right) = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{x - A}{B - A}\right) = \frac{1}{B - A} = f\left( x\right)
