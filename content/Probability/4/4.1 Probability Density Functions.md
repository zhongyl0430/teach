A discrete random variable (rv) is one whose possible values either constitute a finite set or else can be listed in an infinite sequence (a list in which there is a first element, a second element, etc.). A random variable whose set of possible values is an entire interval of numbers is not discrete.

Recall from Chapter 3 that a random variable $X$ is continuous if (1) possible values comprise either a single interval on the number line (for some $A < B$ , any number $x$ between $A$ and $B$ is a possible value) or a union of disjoint intervals, and (2) $P\left( {X = c}\right) = 0$ for any number $c$ that is a possible value of $X$ .

One might argue that although in principle variables such as height, weight, and temperature are continuous, in practice the limitations of our measuring instruments restrict us to a discrete (though sometimes very finely subdivided) world. However, continuous models often approximate real-world situations very well, and continuous mathematics (the calculus) is frequently easier to work with than mathematics of discrete variables and distributions.
