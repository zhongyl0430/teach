## The Normal Distribution and Discrete Populations

The normal distribution is often used as an approximation to the distribution of values in a discrete population. In such situations, extra care should be taken to ensure that probabilities are computed in an accurate manner.

EXAMPLE 4.19 IQ in a particular population (as measured by a standard test) is known to be approximately normally distributed with $\mu = {100}$ and $\sigma = {15}$ . What is the probability that a randomly selected individual has an IQ of at least 125 ? Letting $X =$ the IQ of a randomly chosen person, we wish $P\left( {X \geq {125}}\right)$ . The temptation here is to standardize $X \geq {125}$ as in previous examples. However, the IQ population distribution is actually discrete, since IQs are integer-valued. So the normal curve is an approximation to a discrete probability histogram, as pictured in Figure 4.24.

The rectangles of the histogram are centered at integers. IQs of at least 125 correspond to rectangles beginning at 124.5 , as shaded in Figure 4.24. Thus we really want the area under the approximating normal curve to the right of 124.5. Standardizing this value gives $P\left( {Z \geq {1.63}}\right) = {.0516}$ , whereas standardizing 125 results in $P\left( {Z \geq {1.67}}\right) = {.0475}$ . The difference is not great, but the answer .0516 is more accurate. Similarly, $P\left( {X = {125}}\right)$ would be approximated by the area between 124.5 and 125.5 , since the area under the normal curve above the single value 125 is zero.

The correction for discreteness of the underlying distribution in Example 4.19-that is, the addition or subtraction of .5 before standardizing-is often called a continuity correction. It is useful in the following application of the normal distribution to the computation of binomial probabilities.
