## 4.2.3 Obtaining $f\left( x\right)$ from $F\left( x\right)$

For $X$ discrete, the pmf is obtained from the cdf by taking the difference between two $F\left( x\right)$ values. The continuous analog of a difference is a derivative. The following result is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

PROPOSITION

If $X$ is a continuous rv with $\operatorname{pdf}f\left( x\right)$ and $\operatorname{cdf}F\left( x\right)$ , then at every $x$ at which the derivative ${F}^{\prime }\left( x\right)$ exists, ${F}^{\prime }\left( x\right) = f\left( x\right)$ .

When $X$ has a uniform distribution, $F\left( x\right)$ is differentiable except at $x = A$ and $x = B$ , where the graph of $F\left( x\right)$ has sharp corners. Since $F\left( x\right) = 0$ for $x < A$ and $F\left( x\right) = 1$ for $x > B,{F}^{\prime }\left( x\right) = 0 = f\left( x\right)$ for such $x$ . For $A < x < B$ ,

$$
{F}^{\prime }\left( x\right) = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{x - A}{B - A}\right) = \frac{1}{B - A} = f\left( x\right)
