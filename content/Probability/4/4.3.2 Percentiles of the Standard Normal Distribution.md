## Percentiles of the Standard Normal Distribution

For any $p$ between 0 and 1, Appendix Table A. 3 can be used to obtain the $\left( {100p}\right)$ th percentile of the standard normal distribution.

EXAMPLE 4.14 The 99th percentile of the standard normal distribution is that value on the horizontal axis such that the area under the $z$ curve to the left of the value is .9900 . Appendix Table A. 3 gives for fixed $z$ the area under the standard normal curve to the left of $z$ , whereas here we have the area and want the value of $z$ . This is the "inverse" problem to $P\left( {Z \leq z}\right) =$ ? so the table is used in an inverse fashion: Find in the middle of the table .9900 ; the row and column in which it lies identify the 99th $z$ percentile. Here .9901 lies at the intersection of the row marked 2.3 and column marked .03, so the 99th percentile is (approximately) $z = {2.33}$ . (See Figure 4.17.) By symmetry, the first percentile is as far below 0 as the 99th is above 0, so equals $- {2.33}(1\%$ lies below the first and also above the 99th). (See Figure 4.18.) In general, the $\left( {100p}\right)$ th percentile is identified by the row and column of Appendix Table A. 3 in which the entry $p$ is found (e.g., the 67 th percentile is obtained by finding .6700 in the body of the table, which gives $z = {.44}$ ). If $p$ does not appear, the number closest to it is typically used, although linear interpolation gives a more accurate answer. For example, to find the 95th percentile, look for .9500 inside the table. Although it does not appear, both .9495 and .9505 do, corresponding to $z = {1.64}$ and 1.65 , respectively. Since .9500 is halfway between the two probabilities that do appear, we will use 1.645 as the 95th percentile and -1.645 as the 5th percentile.
