EXAMPLE 4.14 The 99th percentile of the standard normal distribution is that value on the horizontal axis such that the area under the $z$ curve to the left of the value is .9900 . Appendix Table A. 3 gives for fixed $z$ the area under the standard normal curve to the left of $z$ , whereas here we have the area and want the value of $z$ . This is the "inverse" problem to $P\left( {Z \leq z}\right) =$ ? so the table is used in an inverse fashion: Find in the middle of the table .9900 ; the row and column in which it lies identify the 99th $z$ percentile. Here .9901 lies at the intersection of the row marked 2.3 and column marked .03, so the 99th percentile is (approximately) $z = {2.33}$ . (See Figure 4.17.) By symmetry, the first percentile is as far below 0 as the 99th is above 0, so equals $- {2.33}(1\%$ lies below the first and also above the 99th). (See Figure 4.18.)
