When we say that an individual's test score was at the 85th percentile of the population, we mean that ${85}\%$ of all population scores were below that score and ${15}\%$ were above. Similarly, the 40th percentile is the score that exceeds ${40}\%$ of all scores and is exceeded by ${60}\%$ of all scores (having a value corresponding to a high percentile is not necessarily good; e.g., you would not want to be at the 99th percentile for blood alcohol content).

According to Expression (4.2), $\eta \left( p\right)$ is that value on the measurement axis such that ${100p}\%$ of the area under the graph of $f\left( x\right)$ lies to the left of $\eta \left( p\right)$ and ${100}\left( {1 - p}\right) \%$ lies to the right. Thus $\eta \left( {.75}\right)$ , the 75 th percentile, is such that the area under the graph of $f\left( x\right)$ to the left of $\eta \left( {.75}\right)$ is .75 . Figure 4.10 illustrates the definition.

[[EX 4.9]]

> [!definition]
> The median of a continuous distribution, denoted by $\widetilde{\mu }$ , is the 50th percentile, so $\widetilde{\mu }$ satisfies ${.5} = F\left( \widetilde{\mu }\right)$ . That is, half the area under the density curve is to the left of $\widetilde{\mu }$ and half is to the right of $\widetilde{\mu }$ . 


A continuous distribution whose pdf is symmetric-the graph of the pdf to the left of some point is a mirror image of the graph to the right of that point-has median $\widetilde{\mu }$ equal to the point of symmetry, since half the area under the curve lies to either side of this point. Figure 4.12 gives several examples. The error in a measurement of a physical quantity is often assumed to have a symmetric distribution.
