## 4.2.4 Percentiles of a Continuous Distribution

When we say that an individual's test score was at the 85th percentile of the population, we mean that ${85}\%$ of all population scores were below that score and ${15}\%$ were above. Similarly, the 40th percentile is the score that exceeds ${40}\%$ of all scores

and is exceeded by ${60}\%$ of all scores (having a value corresponding to a high percentile is not necessarily good; e.g., you would not want to be at the 99th percentile for blood alcohol content).

DEFINITION

Let $p$ be a number between 0 and 1 . The $\left( {\mathbf{{100}}p}\right)$ th percentile of the distribution of a continuous rv $X$ , denoted by $\eta \left( p\right)$ , is defined by

$$
p = F\left( {\eta \left( p\right) }\right) = {\int }_{-\infty }^{\eta \left( p\right) }f\left( y\right) {dy} \tag{4.2}
$$

According to Expression (4.2), $\eta \left( p\right)$ is that value on the measurement axis such that ${100p}\%$ of the area under the graph of $f\left( x\right)$ lies to the left of $\eta \left( p\right)$ and ${100}\left( {1 - p}\right) \%$ lies to the right. Thus $\eta \left( {.75}\right)$ , the 75 th percentile, is such that the area under the graph of $f\left( x\right)$ to the left of $\eta \left( {.75}\right)$ is .75 . Figure 4.10 illustrates the definition.

Figure 4.10 The $\left( {100p}\right)$ th percentile of a continuous distribution

EXAMPLE 4.9 The distribution of the amount of gravel (in tons) sold by a particular construction supply company in a given week is a continuous rv $X$ with pdf

$$
f\left( x\right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \frac{3}{2}\left( {1 - {x}^{2}}\right) & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right.
$$

The cdf of sales for any $x$ between 0 and 1 is

$$
F\left( x\right) = {\int }_{0}^{x}\frac{3}{2}\left( {1 - {y}^{2}}\right) {dy} = {\left. \frac{3}{2}\left( y - \frac{{y}^{3}}{3}\right) \right| }_{y = 0}^{y = x} = \frac{3}{2}\left( {x - \frac{{x}^{3}}{3}}\right)
$$

The graphs of both $f\left( x\right)$ and $F\left( x\right)$ appear in Figure 4.11. The $\left( {100p}\right)$ th percentile of this distribution satisfies the equation

$$
p = F\left( {\eta \left( p\right) }\right) = \frac{3}{2}\left\lbrack {\eta \left( p\right) - \frac{{\left( \eta \left( p\right) \right) }^{3}}{3}}\right\rbrack
$$

that is,

$$
{\left( \eta \left( p\right) \right) }^{3} - {3\eta }\left( p\right) + {2p} = 0
$$

For the 50th percentile, $p = {.5}$ , and the equation to be solved is ${\eta }^{3} - {3\eta } + 1 = 0$ ; the solution is $\eta = \eta \left( {.5}\right) = {.347}$ . If the distribution remains the same from week to week, then in the long run ${50}\%$ of all weeks will result in sales of less than .347 ton and ${50}\%$ in more than .347 ton.

DEFINITION The median of a continuous distribution, denoted by $\widetilde{\mu }$ , is the 50th percentile, so $\widetilde{\mu }$ satisfies ${.5} = F\left( \widetilde{\mu }\right)$ . That is, half the area under the density curve is to the left of $\widetilde{\mu }$ and half is to the right of $\widetilde{\mu }$ . A continuous distribution whose pdf is symmetric-the graph of the pdf to the left of some point is a mirror image of the graph to the right of that point-has median $\widetilde{\mu }$ equal to the point of symmetry, since half the area under the curve lies to either side of this point. Figure 4.12 gives several examples. The error in a measurement of a physical quantity is often assumed to have a symmetric distribution.
