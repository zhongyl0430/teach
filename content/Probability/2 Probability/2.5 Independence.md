- The definition of conditional probability enables us to revise the probability $P\left( A\right)$ originally assigned to $A$ when we are subsequently informed that another event $B$ has occurred; 
	- the new probability of $A$ is $P\left( {A \mid B}\right)$ . 
- In our examples, it frequently happened that $P\left( {A \mid B}\right)$ differed from the unconditional probability $P\left( A\right)$ . 
- Then the information "$B$ has occurred" resulted in a change in the likelihood of $A$ occurring. 
- Often the chance that $A$ will occur or has occurred is not affected by knowledge that $B$ has occurred, so that 
- $$P\left( {A \mid B}\right) = P\left( A\right)$$
- It is then natural to regard $A$ and $B$ as independent events, meaning that the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one event has no bearing on the chance that the other will occur.

> [!definition] independent vs dependent
> Two events $A$ and $B$ 
> - are **independent** if $P\left( {A \mid B}\right) = P\left( A\right)$ 
> - are **dependent** otherwise.

- The definition of independence might seem "unsymmetric" 
	- because we do not also demand that 
	- $$P\left( {B \mid A}\right) = P\left( B\right)$$
	- However, using the definition of conditional probability and the multiplication rule,
$$
P\left( {B \mid A}\right) = \frac{P\left( {A \cap B}\right) }{P\left( A\right) } = \frac{P\left( {A \mid B}\right) P\left( B\right) }{P\left( A\right) } \tag{2.7}
$$
- The right-hand side of Equation (2.7) is $P\left( B\right)$ 
	- if and only if $P\left( {A \mid B}\right) = P\left( A\right)$ (independence). 
	- Thus the equality in the definition implies the other equality (and vice versa). 
- It is also straightforward to show that 
	- if $A$ and $B$ are independent, 
	- then so are the following pairs of events: 
		1. ${A}^{\prime }$ and $B$
		2. $A$ and ${B}^{\prime }$ , and 
		3. ${A}^{\prime }$ and ${B}^{\prime }$ .
