## EX 2.25

Suppose that of all individuals buying a certain digital camera, ${60}\%$ include an optional memory card in their purchase, ${40}\%$ include an extra battery, and ${30}\%$ include both a card and battery. Consider randomly selecting a buyer and let $A = \{$ memory card purchased $\}$ and $B = \{$ battery purchased $\}$ . Then $P\left( A\right) = {.60}$ , $P\left( B\right) = {.40}$ , and $P\left( \text{both purchased}\right) = P\left( {A \cap B}\right) = {.30}$ . Given that the selected individual purchased an extra battery, the probability that an optional card was also purchased is
$$
P\left( {A \mid B}\right) = \frac{P\left( {A \cap B}\right) }{P\left( B\right) } = \frac{.30}{.40} = {.75}
$$

That is, of all those purchasing an extra battery, ${75}\%$ purchased an optional memory card. Similarly,
$$
P\left( {\text{battery} \mid \text{memory card}}\right) = P\left( {B \mid A}\right) = \frac{P\left( {A \cap B}\right) }{P\left( A\right) } = \frac{.30}{.60} = {.50}
$$

Notice that $P\left( {A \mid B}\right) \neq P\left( A\right)$ and $P\left( {B \mid A}\right) \neq P\left( B\right)$ .
