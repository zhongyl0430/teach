A pictorial representation of events and manipulations with events is obtained by using **Venn diagrams**.
To construct a Venn diagram, draw a rectangle whose interior will represent the sample space $\mathcal{S}$.
Then any event $A$ is represented as the interior of a closed curve (often a circle) contained in $\mathcal{S}$.

Figure 2.1 shows examples of Venn diagrams.
