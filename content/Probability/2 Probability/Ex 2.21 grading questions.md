- There are ten teaching assistants available for grading papers in a calculus course at a large university. 
- The first exam consists of four questions in increasing order of difficulty, 
- the professor wishes to select a different assistant to grade each question 
	- (only one assistant per question). 
- In how many ways can the assistants be chosen for grading? 
- Here 
	- $n =$ group size $= {10}$ and
	- $k =$ subset size $= 4$ .
- The number of permutations is $$
{P}_{4,{10}} = \frac{{10}!}{\left( {{10} - 4}\right) !} = \frac{{10}!}{6!} = {10}\left( 9\right) \left( 8\right) \left( 7\right) = {5040}
$$
- That is, the professor could give 5040 different four-question exams without using the same assignment of graders to questions, 
	- by which time all the teaching assistants would hopefully have finished their degree programs!
