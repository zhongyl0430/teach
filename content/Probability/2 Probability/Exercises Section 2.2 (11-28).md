A mutual fund company offers its customers a variety of funds: a money-market fund, three different bond funds (short, intermediate, and long-term), two stock funds (moderate and high-risk), and a balanced fund. Among customers who own shares in just one fund, the percentages of customers in the different funds are as follows:
- Money-market = 20%
- High-risk stock = 18%
- Short bond = 15%
- Moderate-risk stock = 25%
- Intermediate bond = 10%
- Balanced = 7%
- Long bond = 5%

A customer who owns shares in just one fund is randomly selected.
1. What is the probability that the selected individual owns shares in the balanced fund?
2. What is the probability that the individual owns shares in a bond fund?
3. What is the probability that the selected individual does not own shares in a stock fund?

3. What is the probability that the selected student has neither type of card?
4. Describe, in terms of $A$ and $B$ , the event that the selected student has a Visa card but not a MasterCard, and then calculate the probability of this event.
5. Calculate the probability that the selected student has exactly one of the two types of cards.

Human visual inspection of solder joints on printed circuit boards can be very subjective. Part of the problem stems from the numerous types of solder defects (e.g., pad non-wetting, knee visibility, voids) and even the degree to which a joint possesses one or more of these defects. Consequently, even highly trained inspectors can disagree on the disposition of a particular joint. In one batch of 10,000 joints, inspector A found 724 that were judged defective, inspector B found 751 such joints, and 1159 of the joints were judged defective by at least one of the inspectors. Suppose that one of the 10,000 joints is randomly selected.

1. What is the probability that the selected joint was judged to be defective by neither of the two inspectors?
2. What is the probability that the selected joint was judged to be defective by inspector B but not by inspector A?

A certain factory operates three different shifts. Over the last year, 200 accidents have occurred at the factory. Some of these can be attributed at least in part to unsafe working conditions, whereas the others are unrelated to working conditions. The accompanying table gives the percentage of accidents falling in each type of accident-shift category.

|       | unsafe conditions | unrelated to conditions |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| day   | 10%               | 35%                     |
| swing | 8%                | 20%                     |
| night | 5%                | 22%                     |

Suppose one of the 200 accident reports is randomly selected from a file of reports, and the shift and type of accident are determined.

1. What are the simple events?
2. What is the probability that the selected accident was attributed to unsafe conditions?
3.  What is the probability that the selected accident did not occur on the day shift?

An insurance company offers four different deductible levels-none, low, medium, and high-for its homeowner&rsquo;s policyholders and three different levels-low, medium, and high-for its automobile policyholders. The accompanying table gives proportions for the various categories of policyholders who have both types of insurance. For example, the proportion of individuals with both low homeowner&rsquo;s deductible and low auto deductible is .06 ( $6\%$ of all such individuals).

| Auto | N   | L   | M   | H   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Show that if one event $A$ is contained in another event $B$ (i.e., $A$ is a subset of $B$ ), then $P\left( A\right) \leq P\left( B\right)$ .

An academic department with five faculty members-Anderson, Box, Cox, Cramer, and Fisher-must select two of its members to serve on a personnel review committee. Because the work will be time-consuming, no one is anxious to serve, so it is decided that the representatives will be selected by putting the names on identical pieces of paper and then randomly selecting two.

   Hint: List the equally likely outcomes.
2. What is the probability that at least one of the two members whose name begins with $C$ is selected?
