- Consider a sample space that is 
	- either finite 
	- or "countably infinite" 
		- the latter means that outcomes can be listed in an infinite sequence, 
		- so there is a first outcome, a second outcome, a third outcome, and so on-for example, the battery testing scenario of [[EX 2.12 test batteries]]. 
- Let ${E}_{1},{E}_{2},{E}_{3},\ldots$ denote the corresponding simple events, each consisting of a single outcome. 
- A sensible strategy for probability computation is:
	- First determine each simple event probability, with the requirement that ${\sum P}\left( {E}_{i}\right) = 1$ . 
	- Then the probability of any compound event $A$ is computed by adding together the $P\left( {E}_{i}\right)$ 's for all $E$ 's in $A$ :
$$
P\left( A\right) = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{\text{all }E;s\text{ in }A}}P\left( {E}_{i}\right)
$$
