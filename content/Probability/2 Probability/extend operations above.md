The operations of union and intersection can be extended to more than two events.

For any three events $A$, $B$, and $C$, the event $A \cup B \cup C$ is the set of outcomes contained in at least one of the three events, whereas $A \cap B \cap C$ is the set of outcomes contained in all three events.

> [!definition] pairwise disjoint
> Given events ${A}_{1},{A}_{2},{A}_{3},\ldots$, these events are said to be **mutually exclusive** (or **pairwise disjoint**) if no two events have any outcomes in common.
