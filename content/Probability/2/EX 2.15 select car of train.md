- During off-peak hours, a commuter train has five cars. 
- Suppose a commuter 
	- is twice as likely to select the middle car (#3) as to select either adjacent car (#2 or #4), 
	- is twice as likely to select either adjacent car as to select either end car (#1 or #5).
- Let $p_{i}$ = $P \left( \right.$ car $i$ is selected $\left. \right)$ = $P \left( {E}_{i}\right)$.
- Then we have 
	- ${p}_{3} = 2{p}_{2} = 2{p}_{4}$
	- ${p}_{2} = 2{p}_{1} = 2{p}_{5} = {p}_{4}$.
- This gives
$$
1 = \sum P\left( {E}_{i}\right) = {p}_{1} + 2{p}_{1} + 4{p}_{1} + 2{p}_{1} + {p}_{1} = {10}{p}_{1}
$$
- It implies 
	- ${p}_{1} = {p}_{5} = .1$, 
	- ${p}_{2} = {p}_{4} = .2$, 
	- ${p}_{3} = .4$. 
- The probability that one of the three middle cars is selected (a compound event) is then 
$${p}_{2} + {p}_{3} + {p}_{4} = .8 .$$
