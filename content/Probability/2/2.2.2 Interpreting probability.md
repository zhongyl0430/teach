Examples [[EX 2.11 toss a thumbtack]] and [[EX 2.12 test batteries]] show that the axioms do not completely determine an assignment of probabilities to events.
The axioms serve only to rule out assignments inconsistent with our intuitive notions of probability.
In the tack-tossing experiment of Example 2.11, two particular assignments were suggested.
The appropriate or correct assignment depends on the nature of the thumbtack and also on one's interpretation of probability.
The interpretation that is most frequently used and most easily understood is based on the notion of relative frequencies.

- [[relative frequency]]
- [[limiting relative frequency]]
