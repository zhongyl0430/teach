In our study of probability, we will be interested not only in the individual outcomes of $\mathcal{S}$ but also in various collections of outcomes from $\mathcal{S}$.

> [!definition] event
> An **event** is any collection (subset) of outcomes contained in the [[sample space of an experiment#^def-sample-space|sample space]] $\mathcal{S}$ . 

^def-event

> [!definition] simple vs compound
> An event is **simple** if it consists of exactly one outcome and **compound** if it consists of more than one outcome.


> [!definition] occur
> When an experiment is performed, a particular [[#^def-event|event]] $A$ is said to **occur** if the resulting experimental outcome is *contained* in $A$ .
> 
> In general, exactly one simple event will occur, but many compound events will occur simultaneously.
