- Frequently the nature of an experiment suggests that 
	- two events $A$ and $B$ should be assumed independent. 
- This is the case, for example, 
	- if a manufacturer receives a circuit board from each of two different suppliers, 
	- each board is tested on arrival, 
	- $A = \{$ first is defective $\}$ 
	- $B = \{$ second is defective $\}$ . 
- If $P\left( A\right) = {.1}$ , 
	- it should also be the case that $P\left( {A \mid B}\right) = {.1}$ ; 
	- knowing the condition of the second board shouldn't provide information about the condition of the first. 
- The probability that both events will occur is easily calculated from the individual event probabilities 
	- when the events are independent.


> [!proposition] independence
> $A$ and $B$ are *independent* if and only if (iff)
> $$
> P\left( {A \cap B}\right) = P\left( A\right) \cdot P\left( B\right) \tag{2.8}
> $$

The verification of this multiplication rule is as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
P\left( {A \cap B}\right) 
&= P\left( {A \mid B}\right) \cdot P\left( B\right) \\
&= P\left( A\right) \cdot P\left( B\right) \tag{2.9}
\end{align}
$$
where the second equality in Equation (2.9) is valid 
- iff $A$ and $B$ are independent. 
Equivalence of independence and Equation (2.8) imply that 
- the latter can be used as a definition of independence.
