The computation of a posterior probability $P\left( {{A}_{i} \mid B}\right)$ from given prior probabilities $P\left( {A}_{i}\right)$ and conditional probabilities $P\left( {B \mid {A}_{i}}\right)$ occupies a central position in elementary probability. 
- The general rule for such computations, which is really just a simple application of the multiplication rule, goes back to Reverend Thomas Bayes, who lived in the eighteenth century. 
To state it we first need another result. 
- Recall that events ${A}_{1},\ldots ,{A}_{k}$ are mutually exclusive if no two have any common outcomes. 
- The events are **exhaustive** if one ${A}_{i}$ must occur, so that ${A}_{1} \cup \ldots \cup {A}_{k} = \mathcal{E}$ .

- As long as there are relatively few events in the partition, 
	- a *tree diagram* (as in Example 2.29) can be used as a basis for calculating posterior probabilities without ever referring explicitly to Bayes' theorem.
