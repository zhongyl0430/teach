More generally, empirical evidence, based on the results of many such repeatable experiments, indicates that any relative frequency of this sort will stabilize as the number of replications $n$ increases.

> [!definition]
That is, as $n$ gets arbitrarily large, $n\left( A\right) /n$ approaches a limiting value referred to as the **limiting (or long-run) relative frequency** of the event $A$.

---
The objective interpretation of probability identifies this limiting relative frequency with $P\left( A\right)$.
- Suppose that probabilities are assigned to events in accordance with their limiting relative frequencies. Then a statement such as "the probability of a package being delivered within one day of mailing is . 6 " means that of a large number of mailed packages, roughly $60 \\%$ will arrive within one day.
- Similarly, if $B$ is the event that an appliance of a particular type will need service while under warranty, then $P\left( B\right) = .1$ is interpreted to mean that in the long run $10 \\%$ of such appliances will need warranty service.
- This doesn't mean that exactly 1 out of 10 will need service, or that exactly 10 out of 100 will need service, because 10 and 100 are not the long run.
