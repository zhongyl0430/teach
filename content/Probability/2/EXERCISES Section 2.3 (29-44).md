    the 10 pages, and so on (successive lines were perforated for this
    purpose).

    Bank, there are in fact restrictions on the choice of digits. The
    following choices are prohibited: (i) all four digits identical (ii)
    sequences of consecutive ascending or descending digits, such as
    6543 (iii) any sequence starting with 19 (birth years are too easy
    to guess). So if one of the PINs in (a) is randomly selected, what
    is the probability that it will be a legitimate PIN (that is, not be
    one of the prohibited sequences)?

6.  根据作者当地Chase银行的一位代表的说法，实际上对数字的选择有限制。以下选择是被禁止的：(i)
    所有四个数字相同 (ii) 连续递增或递减的数字序列，例如6543 (iii)

    digits of the PIN are 8 and 1, respectively. He has three tries
    before the card is retained by the ATM (but does not realize that).
    So he randomly selects the ${2}^{\text{nd }}$ and ${3}^{\text{rd }}$
    digits for the first try, then randomly selects a different pair of
    digits for the second try, and yet another randomly selected pair of
    digits for the third try (the individual knows about the
    restrictions described in (b) so selects only from the legitimate
    possibilities). What is the probability that the individual gains
    access to the account?

8.  有人在ATM机上偷了一张卡，并且知道PIN码的第一位和最后一位分别是8和1。他在卡被ATM机保留之前有三次尝试机会（但他没有意识到这一点）。于是他第一次尝试时随机选择了
    ${2}^{\text{nd }}$ 和 ${3}^{\text{rd }}$
    两位数字，第二次尝试时随机选择了另一对数字，第三次尝试时又随机选择了另一对数字（个人知道(b)中描述的限制，因此只从合法的可能性中选择）。这个人在多大程度上能够成功访问账户？

9.  Recalculate the probability in (c) if the first and last digits are
    1 and 1 , respectively.

10. 如果第一位和最后一位数字分别是1和1，重新计算(c)中的概率。
