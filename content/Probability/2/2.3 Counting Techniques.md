- When the various outcomes of an experiment are *equally likely* 
	- i.e. the same probability is assigned to each simple event, 
	- the task of computing probabilities reduces to counting. 
- Letting 
	- $N$ denote the number of outcomes in a sample space and 
	- $N\left( A\right)$ represent the number of outcomes contained in an event $A$ , 
$$
P\left( A\right) = \frac{N\left( A\right) }{N} \tag{2.1}
$$
- If 
	- a list of the outcomes is easily obtained and 
	- $N$ is small, 
- then $N$ and $N\left( A\right)$ can be determined without the benefit of any general counting principles.

- There are, however, many experiments for which the effort involved in constructing such a list is prohibitive 
	- because $N$ is quite large. 
- By exploiting some general counting rules, 
- it is possible to compute probabilities of the form (2.1) *without a listing of outcomes*. 

* These rules are also useful in many problems involving outcomes that are not equally likely. 
* Several of the rules developed here will be used in studying probability distributions in the next chapter.
