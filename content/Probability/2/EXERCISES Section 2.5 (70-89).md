An oil exploration company currently has two active projects, one in Asia and the other in Europe. Let $A$ be the event that the Asian project is successful and $B$ be the event that the European project is successful. Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are independent events with $P\left( A\right) = {.4}$ and $P\left( B\right) = {.7}$ .

The proportions of blood phenotypes in the U.S. population are as follows:

| A   | B   | AB  | O   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

One of the assumptions underlying the theory of control charting (see Chapter 16) is that successive plotted points are independent of one another. Each plotted point can signal either that a manufacturing process is operating correctly or that there is some sort of malfunction.

Even when a process is running correctly, there is a small probability that a particular point will signal a problem with the process. Suppose that this probability is .05 . What is the probability that at least one of 10 successive points indicates a problem when in fact the process is operating correctly? Answer this question for 25 successive points.

In October, 1994, a flaw in a certain Pentium chip installed in computers was discovered that could result in a wrong answer when performing a division. The manufacturer initially claimed that the chance of any particular division being incorrect was only 1 in 9 billion, so that it would take thousands of years before a typical user encountered a mistake. However, statisticians are not typical users; some modern statistical techniques are so computationally intensive that a billion divisions over a short time period is not outside the realm of possibility. Assuming that the 1 in 9 billion figure is correct and that results of different divisions are independent of one another, what is the probability that at least one error occurs in one billion divisions with this chip?

2.  How small should the probability of a defective rivet be to ensure that only ${10}\%$ of all seams need reworking?

1.  Consider the system of components connected as in the accompanying picture. Components 1 and 2 are connected in parallel, so that subsystem works iff either 1 or 2 works; since 3 and 4 are connected in series, that subsystem works iff both 3 and 4 work. If components work independently of one another and $P$ (component $i$ works) $= {.9}$ for $i = 1,2$ and $= {.8}$ for $i = 3,4$ , calculate $P$ (system works).

2.  考虑伴随图片中的组件连接系统。组件1和2并联连接，因此该子系统工作当且仅当1或2中的任意一个工作；由于3和4是串联连接，该子系统工作当且仅当3和4都工作。如果组件之间相互独立工作，并且 $P$ (组件 $i$ 工作) $= {.9}$ 对于 $i = 1,2$ 以及 $= {.8}$ 对于 $i = 3,4$ ，计算 $P$ (系统工作)。

1.  Refer back to the series-parallel system configuration introduced in Example 2.36, and suppose that there are only two cells rather than three in each parallel subsystem [in Figure 2.14(a), eliminate cells 3 and 6, and renumber cells 4 and 5 as 3 and 4]. Using $P\left( {A}_{i}\right) = {.9}$ , the probability that system lifetime exceeds ${t}_{0}$ is easily seen to be .9639 . To what value would . 9 have to be changed in order to increase the system lifetime reliability from .9639 to .99 ? [Hint: Let $P\left( {A}_{i}\right) = p$ , express system reliability in terms of $p$ , and then let $x = {p}^{2}$ .]
