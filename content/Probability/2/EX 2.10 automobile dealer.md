A small city has three automobile dealerships:
-   a GM dealer selling Chevrolets and Buicks
-   a Ford dealer selling Fords and Lincolns
-   a Toyota dealer.

If an experiment consists of observing the brand of the next car sold, then the events
-   A = { Chevrolet, Buick }
-   B = { Ford, Lincoln }
are mutually exclusive because the next car sold cannot be both a GM product and a Ford product
(at least until the two companies merge!).
