In many experiments consisting of $N$ outcomes, it is reasonable to assign equal probabilities to all $N$ simple events. 
These include such obvious examples as tossing a fair coin or fair die once or twice (or any fixed number of times), or selecting one or several cards from a well-shuffled deck of 52. 
With $p = P\left( {E}_{i}\right)$ for every $i$,
$$
1 = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} P\left( {E}_{i} \right)
= \sum_{i = 1}^{N} p = p \cdot N
$$
so $p = \frac{1}{N}$. 
That is, if there are $N$ equally likely outcomes, the probability for each is $1/N$ .

Now consider an event $A$ , with $N ( A )$ denoting the number of outcomes contained in $A$ . 
Then
$$
P\left( A\right) = \sum_{{E}_{i} \text{ in } A} P\left( {E}_{i}\right)
= \sum_{{E}_{i} \text{ in } A} \frac{1}{N}
= \frac{N\left( A\right)}{N}
$$
Thus when outcomes are equally likely, computing probabilities reduces to 
- counting: 
	- both the number of outcomes $N\left( A\right)$ in $A$ 
	- and the number of outcomes $N$ in $\mathcal{S}$, 
- and form their ratio.
