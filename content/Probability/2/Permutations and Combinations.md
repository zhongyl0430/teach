- Consider a group of $n$ distinct individuals or objects 
	- "distinct" means that there is some characteristic that differentiates any particular individual or object from any other. 
- How many ways are there to select a subset of size $k$ from the group? 

> [!example]
> - If a Little League team has 15 players on its roster, 
> - how many ways are there to select 9 players to form a starting lineup?

An answer to the general question just posed requires that we distinguish between two cases. 
- In some situations, such as the baseball scenario, *the order of selection is important*.
	- For example, 
		- Angela being the pitcher and 
		- Ben the catcher 
	- gives a different lineup from the one in which 
		- Angela is catcher and 
		- Ben is pitcher. 
- Often, though, *order is not important* and one is interested only in *which individuals or objects are selected*, 
	- as would be the case in the laptop display scenario.
