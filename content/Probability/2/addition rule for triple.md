The addition rule for a triple union probability is similar to the foregoing rule.

For any three events $A,B$ , and $C$ ,
$$
\begin{aligned}
P \left( A \cup B \cup C \right)
= &P\left( A\right) + P\left( B\right) + P\left( C\right) \\
&- P\left( A \cap B \right) - P\left( A \cap C \right) - P\left( B \cap C \right) \\
&+ P\left( A \cap B \cap C \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

This can be verified by examining the Venn diagram of $A \cup B \cup C$ , shown in Figure 2.6.

When $P\left( A\right) ,P\left( B\right)$ , and $P\left( C\right)$ are added, the intersection probabilities $P\left( {A \cap B}\right)$ , $P\left( {A \cap C}\right)$ , and $P\left( {B \cap C}\right)$ are all counted twice. Each one must therefore be subtracted. But then $P\left( {A \cap B \cap C}\right)$ has been added in three times and subtracted out three times, so it must be added back. In general, the probability of a union of $k$ events is obtained by summing individual event probabilities, subtracting double intersection probabilities, adding triple intersection probabilities, subtracting quadruple intersection probabilities, and so on.
