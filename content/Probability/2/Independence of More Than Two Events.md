The notion of independence of two events can be generalized to collections of more than two events.

两个事件独立性的概念可以推广到两个以上的事件集合。尽管可以通过条件概率和无条件概率来扩展两个独立事件的定义，但沿着上一个命题的思路进行更为直接且不繁琐。

> [!definition] mutually independent
> Events ${A}_{1},\ldots ,{A}_{n}$ are mutually independent if for every $k\left( {k = 2,3,\ldots ,n}\right)$ and every subset of indices ${i}_{1},{i}_{2},\ldots ,{i}_{k}$ ,
> $$P\left( {{A}_{{i}_{1}} \cap {A}_{{i}_{2}} \cap \ldots \cap {A}_{{i}_{k}}}\right) = P\left( {A}_{{i}_{1}}\right) \cdot P\left( {A}_{{i}_{2}}\right) \cdots \cdot P\left( {A}_{{i}_{k}}\right)$$

To paraphrase the definition, the events are mutually independent if the probability of the intersection of any subset of the $n$ events is equal to the product of the individual probabilities. In using the multiplication property for more than two independent events, it is legitimate to replace one or more of the ${A}_{i}$ &rsquo; $s$ by their complements (e.g., if ${A}_{1},{A}_{2}$ , and ${A}_{3}$ are independent events, so are ${A}_{1}^{\prime },{A}_{2}^{\prime }$ , and ${A}_{3}^{\prime }$ ). As was the case with two events, we frequently specify at the outset of a problem the independence of certain events. The probability of an intersection can then be calculated via multiplication.

转述这个定义，如果任意事件子集的交集的概率等于各个单独概率的乘积，那么这些事件是相互独立的。在使用两个以上独立事件的乘法性质时，可以合法地用一个或多个 ${A}_{i}$ 的补集来替换（例如，如果 ${A}_{1},{A}_{2}$ ，和 ${A}_{3}$ 是独立事件，那么 ${A}_{1}^{\prime },{A}_{2}^{\prime }$ 和 ${A}_{3}^{\prime }$ 也是独立事件）。与两个事件的情况一样，我们通常在问题开始时指定某些事件的独立性。然后可以通过乘法来计算交集的概率。
