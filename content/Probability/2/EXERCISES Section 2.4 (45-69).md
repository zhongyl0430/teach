The population of a particular country consists of three ethnic groups. Each individual belongs to one of the four major blood groups. The accompanying joint probability table gives the proportions of individuals in the various ethnic group-blood group combinations.

|     | O    | A    | B    | AB   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1   | .082 | .106 | .008 | .004 |
| 2   | .135 | .141 | .018 | .006 |
| 3   | .215 | .200 | .065 | .020 |

Suppose that an individual is randomly selected from the population, and define events by $A = \{$ type A selected $\} ,B = \{$ type B selected $\}$ , and $C = \{$ ethnic group 3 selected $\}$ .

1. Calculate $P\left( A\right) ,P\left( C\right)$ , and $P\left( {A \cap C}\right)$ .

According to a July 31, 2013, posting on cnn.com subsequent to the death of a child who bit into a peanut, a 2010 study in the journal Pediatrics found that $8\%$ of children younger than 18 in the United States have at least one food allergy. Among those with food allergies, about ${39}\%$ had a history of severe reaction.

If a child younger than 18 is randomly selected, what is the probability that he or she has at least one food allergy and a history of severe reaction?

It was also reported that ${30}\%$ of those with an allergy in fact are allergic to multiple foods. If a child younger than 18 is randomly selected, what is the probability that he or she is allergic to multiple foods?

A system consists of two identical pumps, #1 and #2. If one pump fails, the system will still operate. However, because of the added strain, the remaining pump is now more likely to fail than was originally the case. That is, $r = P\left( {\# 2\text{fails} \mid \# 1\text{fails}}\right) > P\left( {\# 2\text{fails}}\right) = q$ . If at least one pump fails by the end of the pump design life in $7\%$ of all systems and both pumps fail during that period in only $1\%$ , what is the probability that pump #1 will fail during the pump design life?
