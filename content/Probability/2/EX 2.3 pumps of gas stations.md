Two gas stations are located at a certain intersection. Each one has six gas pumps.

Consider the experiment in which the number of pumps in use at a particular time of day is determined for each of the stations.
An experimental outcome specifies how many pumps are in use at the first station and how many are in use at the second one. One possible outcome is $\left( {2,2}\right)$ , another is $\left( {4,1}\right)$ , and yet another is $\left( {1,4}\right)$.

The 49 outcomes in $\mathcal{S}$ are displayed in the accompanying table.

|   | 0     | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | (0,0) | (0,1) | (0,2) | (0,3) | (0,4) | (0,5) | (0,6) |
| 1 | (1,0) | (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) | (1,4) | (1,5) | (1,6) |
| 2 | (2,0) | (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) | (2,4) | (2,5) | (2,6) |
| 3 | (3,0) | (3,1) | (3,2) | (3,3) | (3,4) | (3,5) | (3,6) |
| 4 | (4,0) | (4,1) | (4,2) | (4,3) | (4,4) | (4,5) | (4,6) |
| 5 | (5,0) | (5,1) | (5,2) | (5,3) | (5,4) | (5,5) | (5,6) |
| 6 | (6,0) | (6,1) | (6,2) | (6,3) | (6,4) | (6,5) | (6,6) |

The sample space for the experiment in which a six-sided die is thrown twice results from deleting the 0 row and 0 column from the table, giving 36 outcomes.
