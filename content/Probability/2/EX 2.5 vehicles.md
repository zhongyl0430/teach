Consider an experiment in which each of three vehicles taking a particular freeway exit turns left $\left( L\right)$ or right $\left( R\right)$ at the end of the exit ramp.

The eight possible outcomes that comprise the sample space are ${LLL},{RLL},{LRL},{LLR},{LRR},{RLR},{RRL}$, and ${RRR}$.

Thus there are eight simple events, among which are ${E}_{1} = \{ {LLL}\}$ and ${E}_{5} = \{ {LRR}\}$ .

---
Some compound events include
-   $A$ = { RLL, LRL, LLR } = the event that exactly one of the three vehicles turns right
-   $B$ = { LLL, RLL, LRL, LLR } = the event that at most one of the vehicles turns right
-   $C$ = { LLL, RRR \} = the event that all three vehicles turn in the same direction
---
Suppose that when the experiment is performed, the outcome is LLL.
Then
-   the simple event ${E}_{1}$ has occurred
-   so also have the events $B$ and $C$
-   but not $A$.
