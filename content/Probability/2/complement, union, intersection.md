> The **complement** of an event $A$ , denoted by $A'$, is the set of all outcomes in $\mathcal{S}$ that are not contained in $A$.

> [!definition] union
> The **union** of two events $A$ and $B$ , denoted by $A \cup B$ and read " $A$ or $B$," is the event consisting of all outcomes that are either in $A$ or in $B$ or in both events (so that the union includes outcomes for which both $A$ and $B$ occur as well as outcomes for which exactly one occurs)-that is, all outcomes in at least one of the events.

> [!definition] intersection
