> [!definition] permutation
> - An *ordered* subset is called a **permutation**. 
> - The number of permutations of size $k$ that can be formed from the $n$ individuals or objects in a group will be denoted by 
>   $${P}_{k,n}$$

> [!definition] combination
> - An *unordered* subset is called a **combination**. 
> - One way to denote the number of combinations is 
>   $${C}_{k,n}, $$
>   - but we shall instead use notation that is quite common in probability books:
>   $$\left( \begin{array}{l} n \\ k \end{array}\right) ,$$
>   - read " $n$ choose $k$ ."
