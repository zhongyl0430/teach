The definition of conditional probability yields the following result, 
- obtained by multiplying both sides of Equation (2.3) in [[2.4.1 The Definition of Conditional Probability#^def-cond-prob|defintion of conditional probability]] by $P\left( B\right)$ .

> $$
> P\left( {A \cap B}\right) = P\left( {A \mid B}\right) \cdot P\left( B\right)

- This rule is important because it is often the case that
	- $P\left( {A \cap B}\right)$ is desired, 
	- whereas both $P\left( B\right)$ and $P\left( {A \mid B}\right)$ can be obtained from the problem description. 
- Consideration of $P\left( {B \mid A}\right)$ gives
$$P\left( {A \cap B}\right) = P\left( {B \mid A}\right) \cdot P\left( A\right)$$

- The multiplication rule is most useful when 
	- the experiment consists of several stages in succession. 
- The conditioning event $B$ then describes the outcome of the first stage 
	- and $A$ the outcome of the second, 
	- so that $P\left( {A \mid B}\right)$ (conditioning on what occurs first) will often be known. 
- The rule is easily extended to experiments involving more than two stages. 

> [!example]
> Consider three events ${A}_{1}$, ${A}_{2}$, and ${A}_{3}$. 
> - The triple intersection of these events can be represented as the double intersection $\left( {{A}_{1} \cap {A}_{2}}\right) \cap {A}_{3}$ . 
> - Applying our previous multiplication rule to this intersection 
> - and then to ${A}_{1} \cap {A}_{2}$ gives

> \begin{align}
> &P\left( {{A}_{1} \cap {A}_{2} \cap {A}_{3}}\right) \\
> = &P\left( {{A}_{3} \mid {A}_{1} \cap {A}_{2}}\right) \cdot P\left( {{A}_{1} \cap {A}_{2}}\right) \\
> = &P\left( {{A}_{3} \mid {A}_{1} \cap {A}_{2}}\right) \cdot P\left( {{A}_{2} \mid {A}_{1}}\right) \cdot P\left( {A}_{1}\right)

> - Thus the triple intersection probability is a product of three probabilities, 
> 	- two of which are conditional.
