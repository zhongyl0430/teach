> For any event $A,P\left( A\right) + P\left( {A}'\right) = 1$ , from which $P\left( A\right) = 1 - P\left( {A}'\right)$.

`\begin{proof}`
In Axiom 3, let $k = 2$, ${A}_{1} = A$ , and ${A}_{2} = A'$.
Since by definition of ${A}'$ , $A \cup {A}' = \mathcal{S}$ while $A$ and ${A}'$ are disjoint, $1 = P\left( \mathcal{S}\right) = P\left( {A \cup {A}'}\right) = P\left( A\right) + P\left( {A}'\right)$.
`\end{proof}`

This proposition is surprisingly useful because there are many situations in which $P\left( {A}'\right)$ is more easily obtained by direct methods than is $P\left( A\right)$ .
