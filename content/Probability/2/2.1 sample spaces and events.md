## Introduction: experiment
> [!definition]
> An **experiment** is any activity or process whose outcome is subject to uncertainty.

Although the word experiment generally suggests a planned or carefully controlled laboratory testing situation, we use it here in a much wider sense. Thus experiments that may be of interest include
-   tossing a coin once or several times
-   selecting a card or cards from a deck
-   weighing a loaf of bread
-   ascertaining the commuting time from home to work on a particular morning,
-   obtaining blood types from a group of individuals,
-   measuring the compressive strengths of different steel beams.

### DEF: sample space
> [!definition]
> The **sample space** of an experiment, denoted by $\mathcal{S}$, is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment.
 
 ---
### EX 2.1: two outputs

The simplest experiment to which probability applies is one with two possible outcomes.

For example
1.  examining a single weld to see whether it is defective. The sample space for this experiment can be abbreviated as $\mathcal{S} = \{ N,D\}$, where
    -   $N$ represents not defective
    -   $D$ represents defective,
    -   the braces are used to enclose the elements of a set.
2.  tossing a thumbtack and noting whether it landed point up or point down, with sample space $\mathcal{S} = \{ U,D\}$
3.  observing the gender of the next child born at the local hospital, with $\mathcal{S} = \{ M,F\}$ .
---

### EX 2.2: squence of outputs

1.  If we examine three welds in sequence and note the result of each examination, then an outcome for the entire experiment is any sequence of $N$ 's and $D$ 's of length 3, so
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
       \mathcal{S} = \{ 
       &{NNN},{NND},{NDN},{NDD},\\
       &{DNN},{DND},{DDN},{DDD}\}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
2.  If we had tossed a thumbtack three times, the sample space would be obtained by replacing $N$ by $U$ in $\mathcal{S}$ above, with a similar notational change yielding the sample space for the experiment in which the genders of three newborn children are observed.

### EX 2.3: pumps of gas stations

Two gas stations are located at a certain intersection. Each one has six gas pumps.

Consider the experiment in which the number of pumps in use at a particular time of day is determined for each of the stations.
An experimental outcome specifies how many pumps are in use at the first station and how many are in use at the second one. One possible outcome is $\left( {2,2}\right)$ , another is $\left( {4,1}\right)$ , and yet another is $\left( {1,4}\right)$. 

---

The 49 outcomes in $\mathcal{S}$ are displayed in the accompanying table.

|   | 0     | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | (0,0) | (0,1) | (0,2) | (0,3) | (0,4) | (0,5) | (0,6) |
| 1 | (1,0) | (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) | (1,4) | (1,5) | (1,6) |
| 2 | (2,0) | (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) | (2,4) | (2,5) | (2,6) |
| 3 | (3,0) | (3,1) | (3,2) | (3,3) | (3,4) | (3,5) | (3,6) |
| 4 | (4,0) | (4,1) | (4,2) | (4,3) | (4,4) | (4,5) | (4,6) |
| 5 | (5,0) | (5,1) | (5,2) | (5,3) | (5,4) | (5,5) | (5,6) |
| 6 | (6,0) | (6,1) | (6,2) | (6,3) | (6,4) | (6,5) | (6,6) |

The sample space for the experiment in which a six-sided die is thrown twice results from deleting the 0 row and 0 column from the table, giving 36 outcomes.


### EX 2.4: infinitely many outputs

A reasonably large percentage of C++ programs written at a particular company compile on the first run, but some do not (a compiler is a program that translates source code, in this case C++ programs, into machine language so programs can be executed).

Suppose an experiment consists of selecting and compiling C++ programs at this location one by one until encountering a program that compiles on the first run.

---
Denote

-   a program that compiles on the first run by $S$ (for success)
-   one that doesn't do so by $F$ (for failure).

Although it may not be very likely, a possible outcome of this experiment is that the first 5 (or 10 or 20 or ...) are $F$'s and the next one is an $S$ .
That is, for any positive integer $n$ , we may have to examine $n$ programs before seeing the first $S$ .

---
The sample space is $\mathcal{S} = \{ S,{FS},{FFS},{FFFS},\ldots \}$ , which contains an infinite number of possible outcomes.

The same abbreviated form of the sample space is appropriate for an experiment in which, starting at a specified time, the gender of each newborn infant is recorded until the birth of a male is observed.

---
## Events

In our study of probability, we will be interested not only in the individual outcomes of $\mathcal{S}$ but also in various collections of outcomes from $\mathcal{S}$.

- What is [[#DEF event|event]] and when does an event [[#DEF occur|occur]]
- examples
    - [[#EX 2.5 vehicles]]
    - [[#EX 2.6 events in EX 2.3]]
    - [[#EX 2.7]]

### DEF: event

> [!defintion]
> An **event** is any collection (subset) of outcomes contained in the sample space $\mathcal{S}$ . An event is simple if it consists of exactly one outcome and compound if it consists of more than one outcome.

---
> [!definition]
> An event is **simple** if it consists of exactly one outcome and **compound** if it consists of more than one outcome.

---
### DEF: occur

> [!definition]
> When an experiment is performed, a particular event $A$ is said to **occur** if the resulting experimental outcome is <span class="underline">contained</span> in $A$ .
> In general, exactly one simple event will occur, but many compound events will occur simultaneously.

---
### EX 2.5: vehicles

Consider an experiment in which each of three vehicles taking a particular freeway exit turns left $\left( L\right)$ or right $\left( R\right)$ at the end of the exit ramp.

The eight possible outcomes that comprise the sample space are ${LLL},{RLL},{LRL},{LLR},{LRR},{RLR},{RRL}$, and ${RRR}$.

Thus there are eight simple events, among which are ${E}_{1} = \{ {LLL}\}$ and ${E}_{5} = \{ {LRR}\}$ .

---
Some compound events include
-   $A$ = { RLL, LRL, LLR } = the event that exactly one of the three vehicles turns right
-   $B$ = { LLL, RLL, LRL, LLR } = the event that at most one of the vehicles turns right
-   $C$ = { LLL, RRR \} = the event that all three vehicles turn in the same direction
---
Suppose that when the experiment is performed, the outcome is LLL.
Then
-   the simple event ${E}_{1}$ has occurred
-   so also have the events $B$ and $C$
-   but not $A$.
---
### EX 2.6: events in EX 2.3

([[#EX 2.3 pumps of gas stations]] continued)

When the number of pumps in use at each of two six-pump gas stations is observed, there are 49 possible outcomes, so there are 49 simple events:
- $E_1 = \{ \left( {0,0} \right) \}$,
- $E_2 = \{ \left( {0,1}\right) \}$,
- $\ldots$,
- $E_{49} = \{ \left( {6,6}\right) \}$.
---
Examples of compound events are
-   $A$ = $\{ \left( 0,0 \right), \left( 1,1 \right) ,\left( {2,2}\right) ,\left( {3,3}\right) ,\left( {4,4}\right) ,\left( {5,5}\right) ,\left( {6,6}\right) \}$ = the event that the number of pumps in use is the same for both stations
-   $B$ = $\{ \left( {0,4}\right), \left( {1,3}\right),\left( {2,2}\right) ,\left( {3,1}\right) ,\left( {4,0}\right) \}$ = the event that the total number of pumps in use is four
-   $C$ = $\{ \left( {0,0}\right), \left( {0,1}\right),\left( {1,0}\right) ,\left( {1,1}\right) \}$ = the event that at most one pump is in use at each station
---
### EX 2.7

([[#EX 2.4 infinitely many outputs]] continued)

The sample space for the program compilation experiment contains an
infinite number of outcomes, so there are an infinite number of simple
events.

Compound events
-   $A$ = $\{ S,{FS},{FFS}\}$ = the event that at most three programs are examined
-   $E$ = $\{ {FS},{FFFS},{FFFFS},\ldots \}$ = the event that an even number of programs are examined

---
## Some Relations from Set Theory

An event is just a set, so relationships and results from elementary set theory can be used to study events.
The following operations will be used to create new events from given events.
- fundamental operations: [[#DEF complement, union, intersection|complement, union, intersection]]
    - [[#EX 2.8 operations on events of EX 2.3]]
    - [[#EX 2.9 operations on events of EX 2.4]]
- special event: [[#DEF null event, disjoint|null event, disjoint]]
    - [[#EX 2.10]]
- [[#extend operations above]]
- [[#Venn diagram]]: a visual method
---

### DEF: complement, union, intersection
> [!definition]
> 1.  The **complement** of an event $A$ , denoted by $A'$, is the set of all outcomes in $\mathcal{S}$ that are not contained in $A$.
> 2.  The **union** of two events $A$ and $B$ , denoted by $A \cup B$ and read " $A$ or $B$," is the event consisting of all outcomes that are either in $A$ or in $B$ or in both events (so that the union includes outcomes for which both $A$ and $B$ occur as well as outcomes for which exactly one occurs)-that is, all outcomes in at least one of the events.
> 3.  The **intersection** of two events $A$ and $B$ , denoted by $A \cap B$ and read "$A$ and $B$",  is the event consisting of all outcomes that are in both $A$ and $B$ .

---
### EX 2.8: operations on events of EX 2.3

([[#EX 2.3 pumps of gas stations]] continued)
For the experiment in which the number of pumps in use at a single six-pump gas station is observed, let

-   $A = \{ 0,1,2,3,4 \}$
-   $B = \{ 3,4,5,6 \}$
-   $C = \{ 1,3,5 \}$
---
Then
-   $A' = \{ 5,6\}$
-   $A \cup B = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\} = \mathcal{E}$
-   $A \cup C = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5\}$
-   $A \cap B = \{ 3,4\}$
-   $A \cap C = \{ 1,3\}$
-   $\left( A \cap C \right)' = \{ 0,2,4,5,6\}$
---

### EX 2.9: operations on events of EX 2.4

([[#EX 2.4 infinitely many outputs]] continued)
In the program compilation experiment, define $A,B$ , and
$C$ by
-   $A = \{ S,{FS},{FFS}\}$
-   $B = \{ S,{FFS},{FFFFS}\}$
-   $C = \{ {FS},{FFFS},{FFFFFS},\ldots \}$
---
Then
-   $A' = \{ {FFFS},{FFFFS},{FFFFFS},\ldots \}$
-   $C' = \{ S,{FFS},{FFFFS},\ldots \}$
-   $A \cup B = \{ S,{FS},{FFS},{FFFFS}\}$
-   $A \cap B = \{ S,{FFS}\}$
---

### DEF: null event, disjoint

Sometimes $A$ and $B$ have no outcomes in common, so that the intersection of $A$ and $B$ contains no outcomes.
> [!definition]
> Let $\varnothing$ denote the **null** event (the event consisting of no outcomes whatsoever).
> When $A \cap B = \varnothing ,A$ and $B$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** or **disjoint** events.

---
### EX 2.10

A small city has three automobile dealerships:
-   a GM dealer selling Chevrolets and Buicks
-   a Ford dealer selling Fords and Lincolns
-   a Toyota dealer.

If an experiment consists of observing the brand of the next car sold, then the events
-   A = { Chevrolet, Buick }
-   B = { Ford, Lincoln }
are mutually exclusive because the next car sold cannot be both a GM product and a Ford product
(at least until the two companies merge!).

---
### extend operations above

The operations of union and intersection can be extended to more than two events.

For any three events $A$, $B$, and $C$, the event $A \cup B \cup C$ is the set of outcomes contained in at least one of the three events, whereas $A \cap B \cap C$ is the set of outcomes contained in all three events.

---
> [!definition]
> Given events ${A}_{1},{A}_{2},{A}_{3},\ldots$, these events are said to be **mutually exclusive** (or **pairwise disjoint**) if no two events have any outcomes in common.

---
### Venn diagram

A pictorial representation of events and manipulations with events is obtained by using **Venn diagrams**.
To construct a Venn diagram, draw a rectangle whose interior will represent the sample space $\mathcal{S}$.
Then any event $A$ is represented as the interior of a closed curve (often a circle) contained in $\mathcal{S}$.

---
Figure 2.1 shows examples of Venn diagrams.

### 3

Three components are connected to form a system as shown in the
accompanying diagram. Because the components in the 2-3 subsystem are
connected in parallel, that subsystem will function if at least one of
the two individual components functions. For the entire system to
function, component 1 must function and so must the 2-3 subsystem.

The experiment consists of determining the condition of each component
$\lbrack S$ (success) for a functioning component and $F$ (failure)
for a nonfunctioning component].

1.  Which outcomes are contained in the event $A$ that exactly two out of the three components function?
2.  Which outcomes are contained in the event $B$ that at least two of the components function?
3.  Which outcomes are contained in the event $C$ that the system functions?

A family consisting of three persons -- A, B, and C -- goes to a medical clinic that always has a doctor at each of stations 1, 2, and 3. During a certain week, each member of the family visits the clinic once and is assigned at random to a station. The experiment consists of recording the station number for each member. One outcome is $(1, 2, 1)$ for $A$ to station 1, $B$ to station 2, and $C$ to station 1 .

1.  List the 27 outcomes in the sample space.
2.  List all outcomes in the event that all three members go to the same station.
3.  List all outcomes in the event that all members go to different stations.
4.  List all outcomes in the event that no one goes to station 2.


### 6

A college library has five copies of a certain text on reserve.
Two copies (1 and 2) are first printings, and the other three (3, 4,and 5) are second printings.
A student examines these books in random order, stopping only when a second printing has been selected. One possible outcome is 5 , and another is 213 .

1.  List the outcomes in $\mathcal{S}$ .
2.  Let $A$ denote the event that exactly one book must be examined. What outcomes are in $A$ ?

1.  List all possible outcomes.
2.  Suppose a running tally is kept as slips are removed. For what outcomes does $A$ remain ahead of $B$ throughout the tally?


### 8

An engineering construction firm is currently working on power plants at three different sites. Let ${A}\_{i}$ denote the event that the plant at site $i$ is completed by the contract date. Use the operations of union, intersection, and complementation to describe each of the following events in terms of ${A}\_{1},{A}\_{2}$ , and ${A}\_{3}$ , draw a Venn diagram, and shade the region corresponding to each one.

1.  At least one plant is completed by the contract date.
2.  All plants are completed by the contract date.
3.  Only the plant at site 1 is completed by the contract date.
4.  Exactly one plant is completed by the contract date.
5.  Either the plant at site 1 or both of the other two plants are completed by the contract date.


### 9

Use Venn diagrams to verify the following two relationships for any events $A$ and $B$ (these are called De Morgan's laws):

1.  $ \left( A \cup B \right)' = A' \cap B' $
2.  $ \left( A \cap B \right)' = A' \cup B' $

[Hint: In each part, draw a diagram corresponding to the left side and
another corresponding to the right side.]


### 10

Recall [Example 2.10]({{< relref "20240809153754-d15_2_1_sample_spaces_and_events.md#ex-210" >}}):

1.  In Example 2.10, identify three events that are mutually exclusive.
2.  Suppose there is no outcome common to all three of the events $A,B$, and $C$ . Are these three events necessarily mutually exclusive? If your answer is yes, explain why; if your answer is no, give a counterexample using the experiment of Example 2.10.
