([[EX 2.3 pumps of gas stations]] continued)

When the number of pumps in use at each of two six-pump gas stations is observed, there are 49 possible outcomes, so there are 49 simple events:
- $E_1 = \{ \left( {0,0} \right) \}$,
- $E_2 = \{ \left( {0,1}\right) \}$,
- $\ldots$,
- $E_{49} = \{ \left( {6,6}\right) \}$.

Examples of compound events are
-   $A$ = $\{ \left( 0,0 \right), \left( 1,1 \right) ,\left( {2,2}\right) ,\left( {3,3}\right) ,\left( {4,4}\right) ,\left( {5,5}\right) ,\left( {6,6}\right) \}$ = the event that the number of pumps in use is the same for both stations
-   $B$ = $\{ \left( {0,4}\right), \left( {1,3}\right),\left( {2,2}\right) ,\left( {3,1}\right) ,\left( {4,0}\right) \}$ = the event that the total number of pumps in use is four
-   $C$ = $\{ \left( {0,0}\right), \left( {0,1}\right),\left( {1,0}\right) ,\left( {1,1}\right) \}$ = the event that at most one pump is in use at each station
