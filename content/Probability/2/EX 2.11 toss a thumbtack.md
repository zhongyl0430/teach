Consider tossing a thumbtack in the air. 
When it comes to rest on the ground, either its point will be up (the outcome $U$) or down (the outcome $D$).
The sample space for this event is therefore $\mathcal{S} = \{ U,D \}$.
The axioms specify $P\left( \mathcal{S} \right) = 1$, so the probability assignment will be completed by determining $P\left( U\right)$ and $P\left( D\right)$ .
Since $U$ and $D$ are disjoint and their union is $\mathcal{S}$, the foregoing proposition implies that
$$
1 = P\left( \mathcal{S}\right) = P\left( U\right) + P\left( D\right)
$$
It follows that $P\left( D\right) = 1 - P\left( U\right)$.

-   One possible assignment of probabilities is $P \left( U \right) = .5$, $P \left( D \right) = .5$
-   another possible assignment is $P \left( U \right) = .75$, $P \left( D \right) = .25$.

In fact, letting $p$ represent any fixed number between 0 and 1, $P\left( U\right) = p$ , $P\left( D\right) = 1 - p$ is an assignment consistent with the axioms.
