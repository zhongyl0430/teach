Let $A$ be the event that a package sent within the state of California for ${2}^{\text{nd}}$ day delivery actually arrives within one day.
The results from sending 10 such packages (the first 10 replications) are as follows:

| Package #                 | 1            | 2   | 3    | 4   | 5            | 6            | 7    | 8    | 9            | 10  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --- | ---- | --- | ------------ | ------------ | ---- | ---- | ------------ | --- |
| Did A occur?              | $\mathrm{N}$ | Y   | Y    | Y   | $\mathrm{N}$ | $\mathrm{N}$ | Y    | Y    | $\mathrm{N}$ | N   |
| Relative frequency of $A$ | 0            | .5  | .667 | .75 | .6           | .5           | .571 | .625 | .556         | .5  |

Behavior of relative frequency (a) Initial fluctuation (b) Long-run stabilization
- Figure 2.2(a) shows how the relative frequency $n ( A ) /n$ fluctuates rather substantially over the course of the first 50 replications.
- But as the number of replications continues to increase, Figure 2.2(b) illustrates how the relative frequency stabilizes.
