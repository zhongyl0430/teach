1. If we examine three welds in sequence and note the result of each examination, then an outcome for the entire experiment is any sequence of $N$ 's and $D$ 's of length 3, so
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
       \mathcal{S} = \{ 
       &{NNN},{NND},{NDN},{NDD},\\
       &{DNN},{DND},{DDN},{DDD}\}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
2. If we had tossed a thumbtack three times, the sample space would be obtained by replacing $N$ by $U$ in $\mathcal{S}$ above, with a similar notational change yielding the sample space for the experiment in which the genders of three newborn children are observed.
